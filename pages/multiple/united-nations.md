Three UN agencies are included in the 2018 Aid Transparency Index: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). Being placed in the ‘very good’ category, UNDP leads among the UN agencies. UNICEF is included in the ‘good’ category and UN OCHA is in the ‘poor’ category.

With UN OCHA having improved its frequency of publication to the IATI Registry, all three UN agencies are now publishing on a monthly basis.

While UNDP publishes all indicators in the comparable IATI format, UNICEF provides 82% and UN OCHA only 29% of indicators.

UNDP performs well and is among the top five performers for all components. UNICEF receives above 80% of the total points for all components but performance. Compared to the two other UN agencies, UN OCHA performs significantly less well on all components. It scores well below average on all components but performance and project attributes for which UN OCHA's score lies within the average score.
