The Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) is responsible for the overall coordination of development and cooperation with Eastern Europe, as well as for humanitarian aid delivered by the Swiss Confederation. Switzerland-SDC is not an IATI member but first published IATI data in November 2013.

Switzerland-SDC remains in the 'fair' category.

Switzerland-SDC has reduced the frequency at which it publishes to the IATI Registry, from quarterly in 2016 to less than quarterly in 2018.

Switzerland-SDC is doing well on organisational planning. It publishes all organisational planning indicators in the comparable IATI format, barring audit and country strategies. While the audit is provided elsewhere, country strategies are published inconsistently.

Four out of seven finance and budget indicators are published in a comparable format: commitments, disaggregated budgets, disbursement and expenditures and total organisation budget. There is room for improvement on the commitments indicator and no information at all can be found for capital spend, project budget and project budget document.

Switzerland-SDC makes all project attributes available in a comparable format. However, they do not provide planned start dates and descriptions as well as sub-national locations are among the lowest scoring indicators.

Apart from the two procurement indicators, contracts and tenders, Switzerland-SDC performs well on joining-up development data. Both contracts and tenders are being made available in non-IATI formats but not consistently.

No performance indicators are published to IATI and only objectives are consistently provided in other formats. While results as well as reviews and evaluations are sometimes available, pre-project impact appraisals are not provided at all.

 * Switzerland-SDC continues to publish to version 1.03 of the IATI standard – one of the oldest versions. It should update to a newer version of the Standard so as to take full advantage of the benefits it offers.
 * Switzerland-SDC should resume quarterly publications, if not aim for monthly publications.
 * Switzerland-SDC should improve the comprehensiveness of its publication to include project budget information as well as contracts and tenders.
 * It should prioritise the publication of performance-related information, including pre-project impact appraisals, reviews and evaluations, and results.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Switzerland-SDC should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
