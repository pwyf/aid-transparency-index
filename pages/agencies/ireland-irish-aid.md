Irish Aid is included in the 'fair' category.

The frequency of publication is still low as Irish Aid is publishing less than quarterly.

It publishes 2/3 of the indicators in the IATI format. For the remaining third, apart for tenders which are available on the organisation's website, information is either not available at all or only sometimes.

Irish Aid scores full points for all organisational and planning indicators apart from country strategies, one of its lowest scoring indicators.

Within the finance and budget component, disaggregated budgets, disbursements and expenditures and total organisation budget are published in the comparable IATI format. Out of these, disaggregated budgets scores comparatively low and the total organisation budget is published for one year ahead only. The other finance and budget indicators, project budget, project budget documents, commitments and capital spend are not published at all.

All project attributes indicators but sub-national location are published in a comparable format. Sub-national locations are only sometimes being made available in other formats. There is room for improvement when it comes to descriptions, planned dates and contact details.

Irish Aid scores for five out of seven indicators of the joining-up development data component. Aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status are published to IATI and tenders are consistently made available in other formats. While contracts are sometimes provided on the organisation's website, no conditions are published.

Irish Aid does not score on any of the performance indicators. The objectives provided to IATI did not meet the definition and are inconsistently published in other formats. Reviews and evaluations as well as results are sometimes published whereas pre-project impact appraisals are not being made available.

 * Irish Aid continues to publish to version 1.03 of the IATI standard – one of the oldest versions. It should update to a newer version of the Standard so as to take full advantage of the benefits it offers.
 * Ireland-Irish Aid should aim for quarterly, if not monthly, publication.
 * It should prioritise the publication of more financial and budgetary data, to include project budget data and commitments in particular.
 * It should make efforts to publish timely and comprehensive performance-related information, from objectives to results.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Irish Aid should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
