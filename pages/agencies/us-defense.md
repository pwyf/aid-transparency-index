title: US â€“ Department of Defense (DOD)
---

The Department of Defense (DOD) works to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives, a number of which are foreign assistance-related in approach. Such operations typically work to train, equip and support foreign defense and security establishments under a discrete set of circumstances. Like the other US agencies, US-DOD became an IATI member in 2011. It first published to the IATI Registry in May 2013.

US-DOD remains in the middle of the 'fair' category and is the lowest scoring US agency.

The United States publish to the IATI Registry on a quarterly basis.

All organisational planning indicators apart from annual report and country strategies are available on the IATI Registry. No alternative document is available in other formats.

It performs below average with regards to finances and budgets. It publishes capital spend, commitments as well as disbursements and expenditures in the IATI standard. Disbursements and expenditures, however, is one of the lowest scoring indicators. While project budget documents are sometimes published, project budgets data cannot be found. Neither is forward-looking data in the form of total organisation and disaggregated budgets available.

US-DOD performs well on the majority of project attributes, publishing all of them to the IATI Registry. However, it needs to make sure it also gets the basics right. For example, titles include too many acronyms and descriptions tend to be incomplete. Dates of existing projects do not seem to be accurate. Sub-national locations provided to IATI did not contain the required information and are not available in other formats either.

All joining-up development data indicators are published in the comparable IATI format. However, the information provided for contracts and tenders is not specific to individual activities. While contracts are consistently provided in other formats, tenders are only published sometimes.

It does not receive any points for the performance component. Objectives are sometimes published but results, pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are not published at all.

 * US-DOD should regularly update its data to ensure that dates and activity statuses are correct, as these are critical first steps for people to understand what projects are being implemented and which are closed.
 * It should add project descriptions and improve its financial and budgetary transparency, including project budgets.
 * It should prioritise the publication of key documents, for example country strategies as well as pre-project impact appraisals and evaluations.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, US-DOD should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
