Having changed its name in 2015, Global Affairs Canada is the largest grantor of Canadian ODA and leads Canada’s bilateral development assistance. Its priorities for 2017-18 include commitments to openness and transparency, in particular in evaluation and reporting. Canada took over the Presidency of the G7 in 2018. Canada-Global Affairs became a member of IATI in November 2011 and published its first quarterly data sets in October 2012. Canada-Global Affairs was Chair of the IATI Governing Board and Members Assembly until April 2018.

Canada-Global Affairs remains in the 'good' category. It continues to publish on a monthly basis.

It improved the comprehensiveness of its publication to the IATI Registry, adding contracts, annual reports and its allocation policy.

All organisational planning documents are available in the IATI format but country strategies remains one of the lower scoring indicators.

Canada-Global Affairs publishes all financial and budgetary information in the IATI Standard, barring project budget document. There is room for improvement with regards to disaggregated budgets, project budgets and capital spend.

While it does not provide sub-national location information in inline text, it is noted that as well as co-ordinate locations, activities are also located by region. This is done through the use of gazetteer references.

Canada-Global Affairs does well on the joining-up development data component, ranking second overall. Tenders is the only indicator that is not made available in the IATI Standard but the information can be found elsewhere.

There is room for improvement with regards to performance-related information. Canada-Global Affairs does not publish pre-project impact appraisals, and current evaluation and review documents on projects are only sometimes available.

 * Canada-Global Affairs should prioritise the provision of comprehensive financial and budgetary data, and include tenders in its IATI publication. 
 * It should improve its publication to include pre-project impact appraisals and current evaluations and reviews on individual projects.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Canada-Global Affairs should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
