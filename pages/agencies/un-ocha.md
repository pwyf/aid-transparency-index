The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) is responsible for bringing together humanitarian actors to ensure a coherent response to emergencies. UN OCHA operates Specially Designated Contributions to third parties, including Country-Based Pooled Funds and the Central Emergency Response Fund, as well as UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination Mission Accounts. It also manages the Financial Tracking Service, a clearing house of information on international humanitarian funding flows. UN OCHA is not an IATI member by first published to IATI in June 2014.

UN OCHA remains in the 'poor' category.

UN OCHA has improved their publication frequency from less than quarterly in 2016 to monthly. However, UNOCHA publishes only 29% of the indicators to the IATI Registry.

All organisational and planning indicators are made available but not in the comparable IATI format.

UN OCHA does not score on the two commitment indicators, accessibility and quality of Freedom of Information (FOI), as neither a data portal with current data nor a transparency policy is provided.

Project budget is the only indicator within the finance and budget component which is published in the IATI format. While project budget documents are always published in other formats, no information at all is provided for disbursement and expenditures, capital spend and commitments. The total organisation budget is provided for one year ahead in a PDF format but no forward-looking data is made available for disaggregated budgets.

Within the joining-up development data component, UN OCHA only scores for aid type. Information about the other indicators in this component, including key indicators such as contracts and tenders, cannot be found elsewhere.

UN OCHA performs well on the majority of the project attributes indicators, most of which are published in a comparable format. UNOCHA fails to publish contact details and sub-national location information as well as to provide useful descriptions.

None of the indicators of the performance component are published to IATI. UN OCHA is the only organisation outside the very good and good category scoring on pre-project impact appraisals as they are consistently being made available in other formats. Objectives are always published whereas reviews and evaluations as well as results information are made available sometimes.

 * UN OCHA should publish a disclosure policy.
 * It should start publishing its organisational information to the IATI Registry.
 * It should provide further details on its budgets and finances, as well as consistently publishing performance related information such as results.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, UN OCHA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
