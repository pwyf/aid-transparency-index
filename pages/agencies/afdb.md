The African Development Bank (AfDB) was established to promote regional cooperation and unity across the Africa region. It provides non-concessional and concessional loans, equity investments, loan guarantees, grants and technical assistance to lower and middle-income governments and the private sector. The AfDB became an IATI member in 2011 and started publishing IATI data in June 2013.

The AfDB remains in the 'very good' category in 2018. Since the last Index, the bank improved its frequency of publication from quarterly to monthly.

It makes all of the information captured by the Index available in the IATI format - except for conditions data, which is not published.

It also launched a new project portal: http://projectsportal.afdb.org/dataportal/

The bankâ€™s lowest component ranking is for joining-up development data, with project procurement contracts remaining the lowest scoring indicator.

There is room for improvement in the publication of performance-related information, specifically pre-project impact appraisals, reviews and evaluations and results.

 * The AfDB should make improvements on the publication of performance-related information as well as on contracts.
 * The AfDB should consolidate both of its portals - MapAfrica and the project portal - so that users have a unique entry point to discover and use data on the bank's development work.
 * As the portfolio of the bank is diverse, the AfDB should also consider further extending its transparency efforts to private sector operations and share best practice with other banks and DFIs. 
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, the AfDB should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
