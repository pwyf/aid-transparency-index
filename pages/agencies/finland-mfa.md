The Department for Development Policy sits within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is responsible for implementing Finland’s development cooperation. The four priority areas are the rights and status of women and girls; the growth of developing economies; democratic and better functioning societies; and food security, access to energy and sustainable use of natural resources. Finland has been an IATI member since 2008 and first published to IATI in November 2011.

Finland-MFA is included in the 'fair' category for the first time. It has improved the frequency of its publication from less than quarterly in 2016 to quarterly.

Finland-MFA also improved on the publication of organisational planning indicators. It provides all but country strategies in the IATI Standard but these are consistently published in other formats.

All indicators of the finance and budgets component are provided in the IATI format except project budget documents, which are not published at all. Finland-MFA scores full points for total organisation budget but could improve their data for capital spend and project budgets.

Except for contact details, all indicators of the project attributes component are published to IATI. Sub-national locations are provided in the IATI format but did not meet the definition and are inconsistently published in other formats.

Within the joining-up data component, conditions, tenders and contracts are not published to IATI. While tenders are always published in other formats, conditions and contracts are not published at all.

Finland-MFA does not score on any of the performance indicators. While objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are published sometimes, results and pre-project impact appraisals are not available at all.

 * Finland-MFA should update to a newer version of the Standard so as to take full advantage of the benefits it offers.
 * Finland-MFA should prioritise the publication of performance related information, starting with pre-project impact appraisals and results.
 * It should work to make contracts and conditions available.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Finland-MFA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
