The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is responsible for Norway's development cooperation. The Index takes into account information published by the MFA and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). The majority of Norwegian development assistance is administered by the MFA but some activity-level information is found on the Norad website. Norway-MFA is not an IATI member but started publishing to IATI in December 2015.

Norway-MFA remains in the 'fair' category from 2016.

They have increased their frequency of publication, now publishing on at least a quarterly basis as compared to less than quarterly in 2016.

While Norway-MFA publishes data for all indicators in the organisational planning component, none are published to the IATI Registry. Further, allocation policy and country strategy documents were found to be only sometimes published.

Three out of seven financial and budgetary indicators are published in the IATI format, namely commitments, disbursements and expenditures, and total organisation budget. Two-year forward-looking disaggregated budgets are provided on the organisation’s website. While project budgets are sometimes available, project budget documents are not published.

Norway-MFA scores well for project attributes, but there are some important omissions in their data. Actual end dates are never provided, and while planned dates are sometimes provided, they are not available in IATI data. Subnational locations are also provided sometimes only.

Tenders, contracts and conditions are the only three indicators of the joining-up development data component which are neither published in the IATI nor in another format.

Norway-MFA does not score for the performance component. Objectives, reviews and evaluations and results are sometimes published; impact appraisals are not published.

 * Norway-MFA should improve the comprehensiveness of its publication to include more financial and budgetary information.
 * It should also prioritise the publication of performance-related information, from objectives to results.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Norway-MFA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
