The Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE) is responsible for setting France's development cooperation policy. France-MEAE provides or loans project aid, budgetary aid and technical assistance. France-MEAE is not an IATI member but has published IATI data since January 2014.

France-MEAE is included in the 'fair' category.

It has improved the frequency of its publication, going from less than quarterly in 2016 to monthly publications in 2018.

It also added information on France's open data portal.

None of the organisational and planning indicators are available in a comparable format. Although organisation strategy, annual report and country strategies are published to the IATI Registry, all documents were out of date and more up to date documents could only be found on the organisation's website. However, no country strategies or audits are published.

Only two indicators of the finance and budgets component, namely commitments and disbursement and expenditures, are published to IATI. While the total organisation budget gives an outlook for at least three years ahead, the disaggregated budgets are one year ahead. These pieces of information are published as PDF documents only. Project budgets, project budget documents and capital spend are not published at all.

France-MEAE publishes all project attributes indicators apart from contact details in the comparable IATI format and receives high scores for the majority of them. One exception is actual dates which is one of the lowest scoring indicators.

France-MEAE scores full points for four indicators within the joining-up development data component: aid type, flow type, finance type and tied aid status. Contracts and tenders are sometimes provided in non-comparable and open formats. Conditions are not published at all.

France-MEAE does not score on any of the performance indicators. While objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are published sometimes, pre-project impact appraisals and results are not available.

 * France-MEAE should improve the comprehensiveness of its data, starting by making improvements to the publication of budgetary and financial information as well as performance-related information.
 * This should include at least project budget information as well as results and consistent publication of reviews and evaluations.
 * France-MEAE should continue to provide information on its development activities on France's open data portal and include all of its portfolio.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, France-MEAE should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
