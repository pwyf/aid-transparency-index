The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) provides non-concessional loans, equity investments, loan guarantees, concessional loans, grants and technical assistance to lower and middle-income governments, as well as the private sector, in Asia and the Pacific. It also engages in projects more directly orientated towards social development and poverty alleviation. The AsDB is not an IATI member, but does publish to the IATI Standard. Its first publication was in June 2013.

The AsDB remains in the 'very good' category and tops the Index for the first time. The bank improved its frequency of publication from quarterly to monthly.

It has made information such as contracts, tenders, project budget documents and capital spend available in the IATI format, which it did not in 2016. The AsDB is now publishing all indicators in a comparable format.

The AsDB also switched from using internal sector codes to using the more universal DAC 5-digit sector codes.

The AsDB made notable gains in the performance category, specifically improving on reviews and evaluations, as well as results.

The AsDB continues to publish to version 1.03 - one of the oldest versions of the IATI Standard. However, it is the bank's intention to upgrade to a more recent version later this year.

The AsDB is also working on an updated version of its disclosure policy.

 * The AsDB should continue its efforts to make transparency a priority and update to a newer version of the Standard so as to take full advantage of the benefits it offers.
 * As the portfolio of the bank is diverse, the AfDB should also consider further extending its transparency efforts to private sector operations and share best practice with other banks and DFIs.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, the AsDB should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
 * These priorities should be reflected in the bank's updated disclosure policy.
