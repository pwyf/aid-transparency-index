title: Italy – Agency for Cooperation and Development (AICS)
---

In January 2016, Italy set up the Agency for Cooperation and Development (AICS). It is responsible for implementing Italy's development work across 20 key countries. Italy-AICS is in charge of Italy's IATI publication. It became an IATI member and first published IATI data in June 2017.

As they have started publishing to the IATI Registry, Italy-AICS has made significant progress by moving up from the 'very poor' to the 'fair' category.

Italy-AICS is now publishing data on a quarterly basis.

None of the organisational and planning indicators score for IATI publication. A current annual report as well as an audit and a procurement policy can be found on the organisation’s website. Country strategies are published inconsistently and no organisation strategy nor an allocation policy are available.

Italy-AICS scores for four out of the seven indicators of the finance and budgets component: commitments, disbursement and expenditures, total organisation budget and project budget documents. They perform well on the commitments indicator and are the only organisation in the fair category to score on project budget documents although the score remains relatively low. The total organisation budget is provided for one year ahead only and other important financial information is missing. The project budget information published to the IATI Registry was out of date and current information could not be found elsewhere. No information is available for capital spend and disaggregated budgets.

Italy-AICS is doing well on publishing basic project attributes. However, the sub-national location indicator in Italy-AICS’s IATI data did not contain sub-national location information and the information is not consistently provided in other formats. Actual dates are not made available.

All indicators of the joining-up development component are published to IATI. However, the contracts and tenders provided did not meet the definition. While tenders are consistently published in other formats, contracts are not being made available.

Italy-AICS does not score on the majority of performance indicators. Objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are published in the IATI format but the latter did not contain the required information. They are not published in other formats. While results are sometimes published in non-comparable formats, pre-project impact appraisals are not provided.

 * Italy-AICS should ensure the quality of its IATI data, in particular that the most up-to-date and relevant documents are provided, especially for organisational strategy and commitment indicators.
 * It should further start to regularly update activity dates and statuses to reflect its development work on the ground.
 * Italy-AICS should improve the comprehensiveness of its publication by publishing data on all countries where it operates.
 * Italy-AICS should prioritise the publication of financial and budgetary information, as well as performance-related information.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Italy-AICS should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
