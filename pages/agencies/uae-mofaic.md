Responsibility for development assistance in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was initially spread across more than forty units. It has undergone significant changes in recent years. The Ministry of Cooperation and International Development merged with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in February 2016. The newly created Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation (MOFAIC) maintains overall responsibility for setting policy, geographical and sectoral priorities, as well as for implementation and assessment of the impact of the country’s foreign aid programmes. At present, the UAE-MOFAIC is not an IATI member and does not publish IATI data.

UAE-MOFAIC is in the 'very poor' category and the second worst performer in this year's Index.

As in 2016, none of the 36 indicators are published in the IATI Standard.

UAE-MOFAIC scores on annual report and procurement policy which are both published on UAE-MOFAIC’s website. Information on organisation strategy, allocation policy, contact details and tenders are sometimes available. Information for all other indicators is not published at all.

 * The UAE-MOFAIC should start publishing timely, comprehensive and forward-looking information on its foreign assistance in a comparable and open format.
 * It should work with its counterparts to provide the full picture of its development and humanitarian aid work.
