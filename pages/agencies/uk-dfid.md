The Department for International Development (DFID) is the main bilateral aid agency in the UK, and administers up to 70% of all UK ODA. UK-DFID became an IATI member in 2008 and was the first donor to publish to the IATI Registry in January 2011. It currently chairs the IATI Technical Advisory Group.

UK-DFID remains in the 'very good' category.

They continue to publish on at least a monthly basis.

UK-DFID ranks first overall in the organisational planning and commitments component as all information is provided and made available in an open and comparable format on the IATI Registry.

UK-DFID also makes all financial and budgetary information available on IATI, although there is room for improvement in the provision of project level budgets and disaggregated budgets.

It does comparatively well on all project attributes indicators. While implementers are published on the IATI Registry, they do not appear to be published to the same extent as other pieces of information in this component. Sub-national locations could not consistently be found on the IATI Registry but are available on the organisation's website.

UK-DFID also does comparatively well on joining-up development data. However, there is room for improvement in the provision of contracts and tenders.

With regards to performance-related information, UK-DFID is one of the best performing organisations as it provides information on all indicators. However, results is one of its lowest scoring indicators.

 * UK-DFID should prioritise the publication of sub-national locations to the IATI Registry.
 * It should make further improvements to its publication of contacts and tenders, as well as results.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, UK-DFID should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
