The Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR) is responsible for the European Union (EU) enlargement policies and its relations with neighbouring countries. It manages the bulk of the EU’s financial and technical assistance to these countries. The European Commission became an IATI member in 2008 and DG NEAR began publishing to IATI in September 2013.

EC-NEAR remains in the 'good' category. It publishes monthly and provides 88% of the indicators in the comparable IATI format which is the highest percentage among the EC agencies.

All organisational planning documents are provided on the IATI Registry, except for its allocation policy, which is available sometimes only on its website.

Among the EC agencies, EC-NEAR is the agency that receives the highest score on the finance and budget component. It is the only EC agency to publish project budget documents, although the score for this indicator is comparatively low. There is also room for improvement on project budget data, as well as disaggregated budgets.

EC-NEAR makes all of the project attributes indicators available in the IATI Standard. Sub-national location, however, is the lowest scoring indicator within this component.

It performs generally well on basic joining-up development data indicators such as aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. However, the conditions indicator score is one of the lowest scoring ones and no current tenders could be found in the IATI format. These are available on the organisation’s website. Contracts are not published at all.

Three out of four indicators within the performance component, namely results, pre-project impact appraisals and objectives are published in a comparable format but they are all receive relatively low scores. Reviews and evaluations are not provided in the IATI format and are only sometimes published in other formats.

 * EC-NEAR should make improvements to the publication of performance-related information.
 * It should start publishing contracts and make current tenders available.
 * EC-NEAR should make further improvements to the publication of sub-national locations data.
 * It should also ensure the quality of its IATI publication, starting by regularly updating activity dates and statuses to reflect its development work on the ground.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, EC-NEAR should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
