Operating in around 170 countries, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is one of the worldâ€™s largest multilateral development agencies and aims to eradicate poverty. The UNDP became an IATI member and first published to the IATI Registry in November 2011. Since 2013, UNDP has co-hosted the IATI Secretariat as part of a consortium with Sweden, UNOPS, Ghana and Development Initiatives.

UNDP has maintained its 'very good' aid transparency levels.

UNDP publishes on a monthly basis to the IATI Registry.

It publishes all indicators in the IATI format and performs well on almost all indicators.

UNDP is among the top five performers for all components of the Index, ranking second for finance and budgets, performance-related indicators, as well as project attributes.

While performing well in the overall components, there is still room for improvement for project budgets, results and reviews and evaluations, as well as for contracts, and tenders.

 * UNDP should focus on improving its publication of detailed project budgets, project procurement information, as well as project reviews and evaluations.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, UNDP should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
