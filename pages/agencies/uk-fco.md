The UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) is responsible for several streams of ODA and related funding, including spending allocations from some cross-government pooled funds, such as the Prosperity Fund and the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund. It also oversees bilateral development assistance programmes, diplomacy-related aid costs and some contributions to multilateral organisations. It is responsible for the British Council and the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. The UK FCO is not an IATI member but first published to IATI in July 2013.

UK-FCO is in the 'poor' category.

The UK-FCO publishes less than quarterly.

Only 53% of the indicators are published in the comparable IATI format and missing information tends not to be published in other formats either.

Organisational planning indicators, its organisation strategy, annual report and a procurement policy were made available in the UK-FCO’s IATI organisation file, but an allocation policy, a current audit and country strategies were missing. A current audit is made available on the website but information about allocation and country strategies is published inconsistently.

Disbursements and expenditures, as well as project budgets, are published to IATI but data for any of the other finance and budget indicators is not published. Neither is a forward-looking total organisation budget or disaggregated budgets made available.

The UK-FCO provides information for all project attributes indicators in the IATI format except for sub-national location data, which is not published at all.

Four out of the seven indicators for joining-up development data are published in the IATI format, namely aid type, flow type, finance type and tied aid status. However, conditions, tenders and contracts are not published at all.

The UK-FCO does not provide any information for the performance indicators, neither via the IATI Registry nor in other formats.

 * The UK-FCO should aim for quarterly, if not monthly, publication
 * It should make further improvements to its publication, to include further details on its budgets and finances.
 * It should start publishing performance-related information, from objectives to results.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, UK-FCO should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level
