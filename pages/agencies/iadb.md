The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) provides concessional and non-concessional loans, loan guarantees, grants and technical assistance to middle and lower-income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The IADB became an IATI member in 2011 and first published to IATI in March 2013.

The IADB remains in the 'very good' category.

It has increased its frequency of publication from quarterly to monthly.

The IADB publishes all indicators on organisational planning and commitments, barring its allocation policy, which at the time of review was not accessible.

Information is made available on all finance and budget indicators, barring capital spend. There is however room for improvement with regards to the provision of disaggregated budgets and project budget data.

Since 2016, the IADB has started providing planned start dates in their IATI data. They now publish on all project attributes indicators. However, sub-national locations is the lowest scoring one.

The IADB does relatively well on most indicators for the joining-up data component. There is however room for improvement on the project-procurement indicator, with regards to tenders specifically.

On performance, the IADB publishes all indicators to the IATI Registry. However, reviews and evaluations meeting the definition of the indicator could not be found on the Registry but are available elsewhere. Further improvements could also be made on the publication of IATI results.

 * The IADB should improve its budgetary information to include disaggregated budgets, project budget data and capital spend.
 * It should prioritise the publication of performance-related information, such as reviews and evaluations, as well as results.
 * The IADB should consider further extending its transparency efforts to its private sector arm and share best practice with other banks and DFIs.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, the IADB should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
