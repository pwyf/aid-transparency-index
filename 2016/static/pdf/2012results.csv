All funding through the Adaptation Fund is likely to be considered as climate finance but this term has not yet been defined by the UNFCCC. Response: It is not clear whether donor contributions to the AF should be considered ODA as defined by OECD DAC: in ODA the main objective of funding should be economic development and welfare (http://www.oecd.org/document/4/0,3746,en_2649_34447_46181892_1_1_1_1,00.html).  In the AF, the main objective is to address the adverse effects of climate change (Decision 5/CMP.2), and more specifically to a) assist developing country Parties to the Kyoto Protocol that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting the costs of adaptation and b) finance concrete adaptation projects and programmes that are country driven and are based on the needs, views and priorities of eligible Parties (Strategic Priorities, Policies and Guidelines, in http://www.adaptation-fund.org/sites/default/files/OPG%20Revised%204.4.12%20%28with%20annexes%29.pdf, Annex 1). Funding through the AF may be considered climate finance once that term is defined by the UNFCCC. However, the AF should not be negatively assessed (currently proposed value 1 on a scale from 0 to 4) because of a categorization process that is outside the control of the AF. The AF is absolutely transparent about both the sources and recipients of its funding. Reports are prepared by the trustee for each AFB meeting, most recent is at http://www.adaptation-fund.org/sites/default/files/AFB.EFC_.9.8%20Adaptation%20Fund%20Trust%20Fund%20-%20Financel%20Report.pdf.  Further, many Annex I parties to the UNFCCC did report contributions to the Adaptation Fund in their national communications (e.g. Spain did so in their 5th national communication, page 261 - http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/esp_nc5.pdf), as part of and through their investments in the CDM (the 2% SOP). (Although they did not report the 45 million EUR donation).  Reporting flows under ODA is done by the donor countries and beyond the capacity of the AF. In addition, the OECD Rio Markers are now attempting to track climate finance flows and adaptation was just recently added. A decision similar to Questions 13 and 14 above would be appropriate: as definition of climate finance in relation to ODA has not been set outside of the AF process, AF cannot report on such distinction and the question should not apply.   - "

It is called 'Diretrizes para a CooperaÃ§Ã£o Tecnica Internacional Multilateral e Bilateral'.  http://www.abc.gov.br/documentos/Diretrizes-CTI.pdf ","As Brazil is a very recent player as a donor, it still doesn't have appropriate tools to work in that field. Government prefers to talk about 'Brazilian Cooperation for International Development' rather than â€œAidâ€. They define the international cooperation as non repayable grants invested in other countries. This definition is more restrictive than the one adopted by OCDE. The Federal government has an agency responsible for the technical cooperation (ABC) but more than 60 federal bodies develop direct cooperation. And another area in Foreign Affairs Ministry is responsible for humanitarian actions called CGFome: http://www.itamaraty.gov.br/o-ministerio/o-ministerio/cgfome-coordenacao-geral-de-acoes-internacionais-de-combate-a-fome/ ",
"263","4","7","3","The Brazilian Agency for Cooperation (ABC) is starting to collect information to publish annual reports.

Unfortunately it is not available on their website, only in hard copy: http://cooperacaohumanitaria.itamaraty.gov.br/pt-br/Main.xml  There is also a summary of ABC actions in Africa, which looks similar to an Annual Report, but only from 2010. http://www.abc.gov.br/abc_por/Conteudo/CatalogoABCAfrica2010_I.pdf",,
"264","5","7","2","If the document exists, it is not publicly available. It is important to stress that ABC doesn't have any debate or involvement of civil society organization in its strategy and plans. FA is not a very open Ministry, compared to others in Brazil, and that is why SCOs, networks and social movements are claiming for the creation of a National Council for FA with the participation of civil society representatives - like we have for health, cities, food security, social assistance, among others. It is also important to say that the different federal bodies which implement direct cooperation with other countries donâ€™t publish their strategy or plan either.  An exception is the humanitarian area of FA: they created a Working Group involving 15 Ministries and SCOs representatives to discuss priorities. It is a Presidential Decree (21/6/2006)",,

PWYF Guideline state that we will accept indicative or projected figures.

The Board of Directors would continue to set annual business plan targets within these limits. This ABV path would allow the Bank to frontload its activity in the most difficult years. Implementing this strategy will require additional resources. Specifically, the Bank would over the CRR4 period need: ï‚· an increase in staffing in the range of 100 to 170 (7-12 percent); and ï‚· a cumulative real increase in the budget of between 13 and 19 percent. The additional staff needs are driven by the further deepening of the Bankâ€™s engagement in the early transition countries and in climate change, the added emphasis on policy dialogue, an almost one-third increase in the annual number of new projects and the need to monitor a growing portfolio. Based on full utilisation of the ABV envelope, and prudent operational assumptions, the Bankâ€™s portfolio of projects would grow by 38 percent during the CRR4 period to â‚¬44 billion at the end of 2015, while operating assets would grow by 45 percent to â‚¬32 billion. Financial projections indicate that the Bankâ€™s capital structure would continue to meet the prudential criteria established in the Bankâ€™s recently adopted Economic Capital Policy, but statutory capital utilisation thresholds would be significantly exceeded on the basis of the current capital.'

Often, funds are allocated by donors not long ahead of time, for short time spans (1 year, 2 years) only, and they come heavily earmarked. More information on this issue is publicly available on the UNDP website in the document â€˜Status of regular funding commitments to the United Nations Development Programme and its associated funds and programmes for 2012 and onwardâ€™, which was published as part of the advance documentation for the 2012 Annual Session of the Executive Board (see http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/operations/executive_board/documents_for_sessions/adv2012-annual/)   Finally, UNDP publishes Country Programme Action Plans in every country it works in that provides forward planned budgets three to five years ahead (2011-2015) For example, see the Zambia Country Programme Action Plan here: http://204.200.211.80/joomla/attachments/279_UNDP Zambia CPAP 2011-2015.pdf   - While there are Country Action Plans for each country, this does not give a clear enough picture of UNDP's spending at the organisational level- therefore, I suggest a score of '1' as organisational level budgets to do not appear to exist on a three year basis (rather they are collected on the biennial basis mentioned above.)

The report of the Board of Auditors for the biennium ended 31 December 2011 will only be presented to the UN General Assembly in September 2012, and then be made publicly available on the UNDP website.  UNDP is strongly committed to organizational transparency. The organization aims to disclose its internal audit reports by publishing them on its website, noting that confidentiality may have to be protected in certain circumstances. UNDP proposes a series of steps which, if approved by the Executive Board, will lead to public disclosure of internal audit reports by the end of 2012. In moving towards full disclosure, UNDP will ensure that (a) internal audit reports remain a central tool to  inform senior management in its decision-making; (b) proper diligence is exercised, to which end the quality assurance capacity and the recommendation follow-up processes of the internal audit office will be strengthened, as appropriate, to ensure the integrity and quality of the information disclosed; and (c) there are effective safeguards in place to maintain the confidentiality of any information deemed particularly sensitive. UNDP is pursuing this jointly with UNFPA and UNOPS.  Since the beginning of 2012, UNDP has been publishing on its public website a list of all internal audit reports issued: http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/operations/accountability/audit/internal_audits.html. As a result, what has been audited â€“ and which audit reports can be made available under the confidential disclosure procedures adopted by the Executive Board â€“ is now public knowledge.
