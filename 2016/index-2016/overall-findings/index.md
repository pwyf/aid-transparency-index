### Ten donors have fully met the Busan commitment

Ten donors of all types and sizes, accounting for 25% of total aid, are included in the ‘very good’ category. Each scores above 80% and is publishing timely, comprehensive, forward-looking data in an open and comparable format, meeting the 2011 Busan commitment to aid transparency.

### The quality of data published to the IATI Registry has improved

Overall, progress has been made by donors to improve the comprehensiveness and timeliness of their publications. Most of the data that was collected in the process is available on the IATI Registry, which allows it to be shared and compared across organisations. Over half the organisations included in this Index publish IATI data at least quarterly.

### Key data on development projects from a majority of publishers is still missing

Twenty-eight organisations are still in the ‘fair’ to ‘very poor’ categories. The publication of disaggregated data on donors’ development projects in the IATI Standard (as opposed to planning and financial data on the organisation as a whole) is incomplete. Specifically, information at the activity level on finances (such as budgets), on performance (such as results) and on documents (such as evaluations and contracts), which is important to both aid providers and recipient countries for planning purposes is not always published. For example, thirty providers do not get points for results, meaning either that the information is not published at all or that it is not published consistently.

### The provision of forward-looking budgets information is insufficient

This has been a consistent demand from aid beneficiaries to help with their financial management and planning. Over half of the organisations included in this Index do not publish forward-looking budgets in the IATI Standard, including a breakdown by countries. Twenty-four organisations do not publish budgets for their activities to the IATI Standard.

### Some organisations still fail to commit to transparency efforts

Italy, Japan-MOFA, France-MINEFI and China have been in the ‘very poor’ category for the past three years. The eight organisations at the bottom of the Index have not joined IATI yet. Information from these donors is mostly lacking, raising serious doubts about their commitment to transparency.
