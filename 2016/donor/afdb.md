Established to promote regional cooperation and unity across the Africa region, the African Development Bank (AfDB) provides non-concessional and concessional loans, equity investments, loan guarantees and grants to lower and middle-income governments and the private sector.

#### ANALYSIS

##### Achievements and progress

 * The AfDB has made significant improvement, rising to the ‘very good’ category and meeting its commitment to Busan.
 * The AfDB is one of only two organisations in the 2016 Index to publish all indicators to the IATI Registry, including a complete organisation file with three year forward-looking budgets.
 * At the activity level, the Bank scores well on basic and classification indicators scoring 93% and 91% of the total available points for each category respectively.

##### Challenges and room for improvement

 * There is room for improvement in both data quality and coverage of development activities for evaluations, Memoranda of Understanding, activity budgets and condition data.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS

 * The AfDB should aim to publish to the IATI Registry on a monthly basis.
 * The AfDB should improve the quality and breadth of its data on development activities, specifically on activity-related documents.
 * It should improve data accessibility by allowing for bulk export of the data on its portal under an open licence. It should develop a strategy for internal and external use of its data with all relevant stakeholders, in particular at country level and share best practice with other DFIs to enable them to publish to IATI or improve their existing publication.
