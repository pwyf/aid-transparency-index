Created to promote regional cooperation in the Asia region, the Asian Development Banks (AsDB) original mandate was the financing of infrastructure projects. It provides non-concessional loans, equity investments, loan guarantees and concessional loans through the Asian Development Fund to lower and middle-income governments and the private sector. It now also engages in projects more directly orientated towards social development and poverty alleviation.

#### ANALYSIS

##### Achievements and progress

 * The AsDB ranks in the ‘very good’ category for the second consecutive year consolidating the progress made in 2014.
 * The AsDB publishes a full organisation file to the IATI Registry scoring nearly full points for this category of indicators.
 * Its publication at the activity-level is also very good with all basic and classification indicators published. The IADB is also among the top five performers for activity-level related documents and performance indicators.

##### Challenges and room for improvement

 * It publishes at a quarterly frequency.
 * Four indicators are not published to the IATI registry. Contracts and tenders are published in a non-IATI format while activity budgets are only published sometimes in a PDF format and the budget identifier is not published at all.
 * The AsDB does not publish results data and does not publish sectors using the standard codelist.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS

 * The AsDB should aim to publish to the IATI Registry on a monthly basis.
 * The AsDB should publish all fields to the IATI Standard starting with all finance and performance indicators, at the activity-level.
 * It should design a strategy for internal and external use of its data particularly at country level. It should share good practice with other development finance institutions (DFIs) to help them publish to IATI or improve their existing publications.
