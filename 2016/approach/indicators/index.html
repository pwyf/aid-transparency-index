                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>The definition used in the Global RTI Rating is that it has to be a law in the strict sense, it must include the right of access to information, this right has to be enforceable and there must be complaint, court and high court appeal possibilities. Decrees are included if they meet the same standards. In addition, the FOIA must be in use for at least the executive part of the government; therefore, FOIAs which are only adopted, approved or still in draft form are not counted.</p>
                        <p>For multilateral donors, international finance institutions (IFIs) and private foundations, a disclosure or transparency policy is accepted as equivalent to a FOIA. Publish What You Fund completes an assessment of the quality of these disclosure policies based on the overarching approach taken in the Global RTI Rating.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated using a three-point scale.</p>

                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>The Busan Partnership agreement required schedules for implementing the common standard to be published by December 2012. Publish What You Fund conducted an assessment of the schedules completed by development providers and submitted to the OECD common standard implementation website. Schedules are scored on the level of ambition shown by organisations in implementing the IATI component of the common standard. The complete assessment can be found on Publish What You Fund’s <a href="http://tracker.publishwhatyoufund.org/plan/organisations/">Aid Transparency Tracker</a> website.</p>
                        <p>IATI implementation schedules are also accepted.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on the total points received out of 100 in Publish What You Fund&#8217;s analysis of Busan common standard/IATI implementation schedules.</p>

                    <h6 style="margin-left:25px;">3. Accessibility</h6>
                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>The overall accessibility of aid information through the organisations’ portals, project databases or searchable data sources. These are scored using three criteria: 1) the portal allows free, bulk export of data; 2) it contains detailed disaggregated data; 3) the data is published under an open licence.</p>
                        <p>Data sources are the organisations’ own aid portals, publicly accessible databases or websites – accessed in that order. The portal or database must include information on current activities for the countries or sectors the organisation is working in rather than just one individual country/sector or a selected group. It should contain information on at least five of the activity-level indicators, at least one of which should cover financial information.</p>
                        <p>The same data source is used for all three checks. For example, if the aid portal does not state that the data is published under an open licence, this is not checked elsewhere on the organisation’s project database or website. If the organisation’s website is the data source then it cannot score on the “free bulk export” criterion.</p>
                        <p>If a portal allows bulk export through its API but not through its web-user interface, this is accepted as allowing free, bulk export of data.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated using a three-point scale as per the criteria define above. Each criterion carries 33.33% of the total possible score on this indicator.</p>

                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>An overarching strategy document explains the general approach and policies of the organisation towards international development. This should be forward looking.</p>
                        <p>For organisations whose primary mandate is not development, documents clarifying their overarching development strategy are accepted. This information needs to be forward looking.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on accessibility.</p>

                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>Annual reports outline basic (normally aggregate) information about how aid was spent in the previous year, broken down by sector and/or country. This should be backward looking.</p>
                        <p>Annual reports which are up to date within their regular cycle, i.e. the organisation publishes an annual report a year behind, the most recent document within this time frame are accepted.</p>
                        <p>To score for this indicator, the annual report needs to include details of where the organisation is spending its resources and the information needs to be forward-looking, i.e. cover current activity period.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on accessibility.</p>
                        <h4>Weighting</h4>

                    <h6 style="margin-left:25px;">6. Allocation Policy</h6>
                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>Aid allocation policies are the detailed policy documents by which the organisation chooses where to spend its resources, i.e. on which countries or themes rather than others. Relatively general documents or web pages outlining which countries, themes and institutions the agency will fund are accepted, as long as this is forward looking and not wholly retrospective.</p>
                        <p>For organisations such as IFIs and private foundations which do not have an “aid allocation” policy, equivalent documents are accepted; for example, “investment strategy/policy” or “grant-making policy”.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on accessibility.</p>
                        <h4>Weighting</h4>

                    <h6 style="margin-left:25px;">7. Procurement Policy</h6>
                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>An organisation’s procurement procedures explain the process used to tender and contract (invite bids for) goods and services. This must fully explain the criteria on which decisions are made, and could be in a single procurement policy document or attached to each tender.</p>
                        <p>For IFIs which are often demand-driven, this is understood as their investment policy. For private foundations, this is their grant making policy.</p>
                        <p>For organisations that do not undertake procurement related to aid projects (e.g. if procurement is undertaken by grantees or other implementing agencies), a statement explicitly clarifying this is required, as well as the overall policy for procuring goods and services at the headquarter level.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on accessibility.</p>
                        <h4>Weighting</h4>

                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>A country strategy paper sets out the organisation’s planned approach and activities in the recipient country. For it to be accepted it needs to be a detailed document, rather than just a paragraph on the organisation’s website.</p>
                        <p>For organisations such as IFIs, philanthropic organisations and vertical funds which may not have country-level strategies, mid-level documents between organisation and activity-level are accepted, e.g. thematic or sectoral level documents.</p>
                        <p>If the organisation follows the strategy of a parent or related organisation, a statement clarifying this is needed on the website along with a link to the relevant strategy document. Similarly, if the organisation supports a country-led or developed strategy, this must be explicitly stated on the website and the link to the relevant strategy document needs to be provided.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on accessibility.</p>

                    <h6 style="margin-left:25px;">9. Total Organisation Budget</h6>
                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>The total organisation budget is the total amount that the organisation will be allocated by the government or its funders per year for the next three years. This is money going to the organisation and can be indicative. Each year ahead is worth one third of the total possible score for this indicator. Aggregate budgets of between 2–3 years are scored the same as 1 year forward budgets.</p>
                        <p>IFIs and DFIs do not have budgets allocated to them as traditional aid agencies do. In many cases, total budgets are established annually, once total financial figures of all investments are taken into account. However, they do have projected total spend figures that they sometimes publish. If published, these projected figures are accepted for this indicator.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, for private foundations and humanitarian agencies, indicative figures of available funds are accepted.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on format and number of years for which data is provided.</p>

                    <h6 style="margin-left:25px;">10. Disaggregated Budget</h6>
                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>The organisation’s annual forward planning budget for assistance is the disaggregated budget that the organisation or agency will spend on different countries, programmes and institutions per year, for at least the next three years. The figure could be indicative.</p>
                        <p>Scores are awarded on the basis of the number of years (up to three years) for which organisations are publishing budget information. Each year ahead is worth 33.33 points out of a total possible score of 100. Aggregate budgets of between 2–3 years are scored the same as 1 year forward budgets.</p>
                        <p>Both country budgets and thematic budgets are accepted for organisations that prioritise their work by countries. Projected figures disaggregated along thematic and sectoral priorities, at a near similar level of detail to total organisation budgets are accepted. IFIs and DFIs sometimes publish “road maps” which contain this information.</p>
                        <p>The start and end date for forward budgets are calculated based on organisations&#8217; fiscal years for information collected via the survey. Budgets need to run up to a minimum of December 2016 to score for &#8216;three years forward&#8217;. Organisations at the end of their fixed budget cycles and therefore without a published budget for the next three years do not receive points for this indicator.</p>
                        <p>Forward Spending Survey data reported to the OECD DAC is taken into account only if it is available for the specific organisation under assessment.</p>
                        <p>The score for this indicator is graduated based on format and number of years for which data is provided.</p>

                    <div class="indicator-details">
                        <p>The organisation’s annual audit of its activities is an official inspection of the accounts and activities of this organisation, typically by an independent body.</p>
                        <p>Audits up to date with regular audit cycles are accepted, i.e. if the organisation publishes biennial audits, the most recent document within this time frame is accepted.</p>
                        <p>A formally approved audit of annual accounts is required to score on this indicator. Audits conducted by official government agencies such as State Audit Offices or Controller General Reports are accepted for this indicator.</p>

                        <p>The implementer of the activity is the organisation which is principally responsible for delivering this activity.</p>
                        <p>This information may not be available in all cases due to “legitimate exclusions”. For example, humanitarian agencies may not be able to reveal who the implementing agencies are due to security reasons.

                        <p>The activity identifier is a unique reference ID for the activity, e.g. a project number. It allows an activity to be referred to and searched for by a code, which can be used to retrieve the project from a database or filing system.</p>

                        <p>The description of the activity is a descriptive text, longer than the title, explaining what the activity is. Sometimes it is just a short sentence but could also be more detailed. Either is accepted.</p>

                        <p>The planned dates are the dates that the activity is scheduled to start and end on.

                        <p>The budget identifier helps to explain aid flows in the context of the recipient government&#8217;s own budget. It does not relate only to those flows that are direct to the government (&#8220;on budget&#8221;), but also to other flows which may relate to the government&#8217;s own budget. In cases where the organisation is only providing private sector investment, budget classifications are still possible. Such activities could, for example, be classified as current expenditure under the microfinance and financial services function.</p>

                        <p>Both current and completed activities are considered for this indicator. If the activity is ongoing then the expected results should be available. If the activity has ended then the actual results should be available within 12 months of ending.</p>

                        <p>Pre-project impact appraisals explain the totality of positive and negative, primary and secondary effects expected to be produced by a development intervention.</p>
                        <p>Environmental impact assessments as well as impact assessments which explain what objectives the project itself intends to provide are accepted.</p>
                        <p>IFIs and DFIs tend only to publish impact appraisals if regulations require them to, but given the link they have to the eventual impact and results of the activity, all organisations included in the Index are scored on this indicator.</p>
                        <p>For loans or private sector investment, risk assessments and the fiscal objectives detailed in the loan document are accepted. These need to be sufficiently detailed and include any criteria used to assess eligibility for receiving the loan.</p>
                        <p>Humanitarian Implementation Plans (HIPs) and project plans are accepted for humanitarian agencies.</p>

They are specific to an individual activity and explain what the recipient must do in order to be eligible for the funds to be released.</p>
                        <p>The conditions should include loan repayment terms if the activity is financed by a loan.</p>
                        <p>For IFIs and DFIs, this includes loan repayment conditions or special terms and conditions. In cases where the loan repayment terms are considered commercially sensitive, this information can be redacted. The reason for the redactions needs to be explicitly stated in detail and must clarify why the information is commercially sensitive and would cause material and direct harm if published.</p>
                        <p>For private foundations and humanitarian agencies, statements setting out what the grant can be spent on are accepted.</p>
                        <p>Templates for general terms and conditions are not accepted for scoring this indicator. If there are no policy, performance or fiduciary conditions associated with an activity, this must be explicitly stated.</p>
