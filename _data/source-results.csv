Such forward looking budgets or plans are not produced in EIB. The business model on which basis the EIB operates as a financing institution does in fact not allow such a detailed forward planning. For example, the EIB signs finance contracts with a counterpart for the financing of a particular activity. However, one cannot say at what moment these funds will actually be disbursed. It is up to the counterpart to request the disbursement. The disbursement is therefore much more demand driven as in a grant making institution.

EIB is following the specific DFI/IFI IATI implementation schedule that recognizes the specificity of financial institutions.

The EIB Corporate Operational Plan (COP) comes closest to a forward-looking planning, with indicative amounts for regions over the next three years. This has been accepted in the past by PWYF as sufficient to score on this indicator. The Corporate Operational Plan is published in EIB’s IATI organizational file.

2) It contains detailed disaggregated data: The landing page in open.unicef.org contains fund information by donors (“where the money comes from”), regional distribution (“where the money goes”), and sector distribution (“what the money is spent on”). Further details of spending can be accessed by top countries by clicking on the regional pie and by top programme areas (e.g. Education is broken down into “Education in emergencies”) Users can explore the data from an interactive “Flow” page: https://open.unicef.org/flow/ 
In addition, the map pages have separate tabs: “Overview”, “Funds Available”, and “Spent”. This can be found for UNICEF as a whole and for each country. The “Overview” tab indicates the amount planned to be spent, while the “Spent” tab indicates the aid amount spent. 
Each country page in the portal contains comprehensive results which can be expanded on any activity. By drilling through to the activity level, a pop-up box appears with details for each activity as follows: financial information, narrative on status of results, including indicator table with baselines, targets and status, and links to strategy documents and reports.

3) The data is published under an open license: UNICEF fulfills this criteria as it indicates publication of its data under an open license specified at the bottom of each page in https://open.unicef.org/ as follows: 
“All financial information on this website should always be considered as provisional and its use and re-use must conform to the Open Database License (ODbL) and UNICEF’s Information Disclosure Policy.”

As you notice, only one panel member is UNDP internal (Ethics Office) out of five panel members.  The UN and other UN agencies are different entities to UNDP, and hence, the members from the UN and other UN agencies should be considered external.

It is possible to request them for a specific project but theirs is no guarantee that it will be transmitted. Indeed, Oxfam published a report on energy in October 2017 and analysed the energy portfolio of the AFD for the past 10 years. We were told that the project partners (i.e. those who will implement the project) own those appraisals and can decide, or not, to publish them. This is particularly true for the social and environmental impact studies. This means that it is very challenging to evaluate independently a project. Opacity is even more prominent within Proparco which funds the private sector: it is therefore difficult to analyse if a specific project will deliver on poverty reduction objectives – which are supposed to be at the heart of what AFD does (and Proparco).

Aid explorer definitely wasn't designed with this in mind.  When I go to d-portal-also not great for making sure all information can be found- if you click on active projects listed for 2019 and scroll through them the amount is listed with blue shading suggesting how much was spent and by default how much is left.  If you click on the project where that information comes from is completely unknown.  But clearly it is published somewhere.  I doubt it is complete as only 333 projects are listed as being active in 2019 and that is probably a very small portion.  But there is some kind of updated budget reporting happening somewhere at least in their IATI data file.  It is unclear if this is broken down into quarterly or annual chunks, and so I don't suggest a full score, but there is at least some effort to publish project budget information. ",0
