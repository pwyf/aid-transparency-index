- The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) remains in the fair category from 2016
- They have increased their frequency of publication, now publishing on at least a monthly basis (previously quarterly)
- Allocation policy and objectives are now published to the IATI registry. 
- Total budgets are now available and published in IATI, and project budgets are also now published in an IATI format for some activities. However, the finance and budgets component is still the one in which EBRD achieves its lowest rank.
- EBRD perform well on the project attributes component, but their activity titles failed sampling due to heavy use of acronyms
- Despite a low overall score on the performance component, they actually ranked relatively highly, by virtue of publishing objectives documents for all current activities
