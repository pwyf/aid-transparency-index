China published its first White Paper on its foreign aid policy in 2011 and a second in July 2014. According to this, China provides grants, interest-free loans and concessional loans. China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) is in charge of development policy and projects. At present, China is not an IATI member and does not publish IATI data.

As in previous years, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (China-MOFCOM) remains in the very poor category, coming last on this year's Index.
China-MOFCOM does not publish to the IATI standard, thus no information is available in a comparable format. 
China-MOFCOM scores on just one indicator – freedom of information legislation within the organisational planning and commitments component. No comprehensive listing of all its projects is publicly available.
China-MOFCOM did not respond to requests for feedback on the survey.

In March 2018, China announced the establishment of an international development agency which will report directly to the State Council. The main objectives stated are to improve cooperation and coordination across agencies involved in China's international development as well as to support China’s Belt and Road initiative. Its main tasks are not only to design aid policies and plans but also to approve, monitor and evaluate projects.
