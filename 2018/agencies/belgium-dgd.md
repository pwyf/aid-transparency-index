Belgium, DGD continues to excel, raising from very poor in 2014, fair in 2016 and now sits in the good category. 

DGD have improved the timeliness of their data, now publishing monthly. 

DGD performs best on the project attributes component. All indicators are published in an IATI format except sub-national location which is only sometimes published on their website.

DGD scores high for all indicators within the joined-up development data component apart from the two procurement indicators, contracts and tenders. Both are not published in a comparable formats and only tenders are consistently provided in other formats. Contracts are not made available at all. 

Four of the organisational planning indicators, namely organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy and country strategies, are published via DGD’s IATI data. The country strategies provided are out of date and documents for allocation policy do not contain the required information. While an allocation policy is provided in another format, current country strategies are only published sometimes. Despite not being made available in a comparable format, DGD’s procurement policy and audit are published consistently in other formats.

DGD has started publishing project budget documents to IATI, leaving capital spend and disaggregated budgets as the two indicators within the finance and budget component not published. They achieve high scores for commitments as well as disbursements and expenditures. While the total organisation budget is provided for three years ahead only.
