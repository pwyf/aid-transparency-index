The Directorate-General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DGD) is responsible for setting Belgium's development policy and allocating its aid. Belgium became an IATI member in 2012 and first published to IATI in December 2014.

Belgium-DGD continues to make progress, raising from the very poor category in 2014 to the good category in 2018. 

Belgium-DGD has improved the frequency of publication of its data, now publishing monthly. 

DGD performs best on the project attributes component. All indicators are published in an IATI format except sub-national location which is only sometimes published on its website.

DGD scores comparatively high for all indicators within the joined-up development data component apart from the procurement indicator, contracts and tenders. Tenders are consistently provided in other formats. Contracts are not made available at all. 

Four of the organisational planning indicators, namely organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy and country strategies, are published via Belgium-DGD’s IATI data. There is however room for improvement in the quality of the information provided on the IATI Registry. For example, country strategies provided were out of date and current ones could only be found sometimes elsewhere. Despite not being made available in an open and comparable format, DGD’s procurement policy and audit are published consistently in other formats.

DGD has started publishing project budget documents to the IATI Registry, leaving capital spend and disaggregated budgets as the two indicators within the finance and budget component not published. 

With regards to performance related information, Belgium-DGD does comparatively well on publishing objectives and pre-project impact appraisals in the IATI format. No current information however is available on reviews and evaluations as well as results.
