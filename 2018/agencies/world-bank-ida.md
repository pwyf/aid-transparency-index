IDA was the first multilateral development bank to become an IATI member in 2008. It first published to the IATI Registry in March 2011.

The World Bank's International Development Association (World Bank-IDA) has kept up its very good transparency levels but has been overtaken by the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank as the best performing development finance institution.

World Bank-IDA publishes to the IATI Registry on a quarterly basis.

The World Bank-IDA publishes all indicators in the IATI format, barring capital spend.

The World Bank-IDA performs well for all organisational and planning indicators.   

The World Bank-IDA scores below average within the very good category with regards to finance and budgets. The total organisation budget is provided for one year ahead only and capital spend information is not published to IATI nor in other formats. 

The World Bank-IDA performs well on all project attributes but project titles. The titles provided contain many acronyms making it difficult for external people to use this information. 

They are among the top five performers for joined-up development data.

World Bank-IDA is further among the top five performers for the performance component. It has started publishing results data to IATI and also does comparatively well on objectives as well as pre-project impact appraisals. The review and evaluation documents provided in the IATI Standard did not meet the definition of the indicator. But documents which meet the requirements are made available in other formats.
