The International Development Association (IDA) is the concessional lending arm of the World Bank Group. It also provides grants and contributes to debt relief initiatives. IDA was the first multilateral development bank to become an IATI member in 2008. It first published to the IATI Registry in March 2011.

The World Bank's International Development Association (World Bank-IDA) has kept up its very good transparency levels but has been overtaken by the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank as the best performing development finance institution.

World Bank-IDA publishes to the IATI Registry on a quarterly basis.

The World Bank-IDA publishes all indicators in the IATI format, barring capital spend and current project reviews and evaluations.

The World Bank-IDA performs well for all organisational and planning indicators as information is provided on all indicators in an open and comparable format.  

The World Bank-IDA however scores below average within the very good category with regards to finance and budgets as capital spend information is not provided and there is room for improvement in the provision of forward looking budgets. 

The World Bank-IDA performs well on all project attributes but project titles. The titles provided on the IATI Registry contain many acronyms making it difficult for non-experts to use this information. 

They are among the top five performers for joined-up development data.

World Bank-IDA is further among the top five performers for the performance component. It has started publishing results data to the IATI Registry and does comparatively well on objectives as well as pre-project impact appraisals. Project reviews and evaluations are not avilable in the IATI format but can be found elsewhere.

The WB-IDA should ensure that the basics of its IATI data are provided, such as titles that can be understood by non-experts.

It should make further improvement to its publication of budgetary and financial data, to include capital spend and forward looking budgets.

It should add its project reviews and evaluations to its IATI pblication and make them comparable with other organisations.

To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, the World Bank-IDA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
