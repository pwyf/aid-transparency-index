The World Bank, IDA has kept up its very good transparency levels but has been overtaken by the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank as the best performing development finance institution.

On a quarterly basis, the WB-IDA publishes all indicators in an IATI format, barring capital spend as well as reviews and evaluations. 

The WB, IDA scores full points for all organisational and planning indicators, namely organisation strategy, allocation policy, annual report, procurement policy, audit and country strategies.   

They are among the top 5 performers for joined-up development data, doing very well on all indicators within this component.

WB, IDA is further among the top 5 performers for the performance component. They have started publishing results data to IATI and also score highly on objective as well as pre-project impact appraisals. The review and evaluation documents provided in IATI do not meet the definition of the indicator. But documents which meet the requirements are consistently made available in other formats.

The WB-IDA performs well on all project attributes but project titles. The titles provided contain many acronyms and are not useful for data users which is reflected in the decreased score for this indicator. 

The WB, IDA scores below average within the very good category with regards to finance and budgets. Capital spend information is not published in IATI and is not provided in other formats. The total organisation budget is available for 3 years ahead but only an aggregated fogure is given.
