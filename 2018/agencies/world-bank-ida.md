The World Bank-IDA has kept up its very good transparency levels but has been overtaken by the Asian Development Bank and the African Development Bank as the best performing development finance institution.

WB-IDA publishes on a quarterly basis.

The WB-IDA publishes on most indicators in the IATI format, barring capital spend as well as reviews and evaluations. 

The WB-IDA performs well for all organisational and planning indicators.   

They are among the top 5 performers for joined-up development data.

WB-IDA is further among the top 5 performers for the performance component. They have started publishing results data to IATI and also do comparatively well on objectives as well as pre-project impact appraisals. The review and evaluation documents provided in the IATI standard do not meet the definition of the indicator. But documents which meet the requirements are made available in other formats.

The WB-IDA performs well on all project attributes but project titles. The titles provided contain many acronyms making it difficult for external people to use this information. 

The WB-IDA scores below average within the very good category with regards to finance and budgets. Capital spend information is not published to IATI and is not provided in other formats.
