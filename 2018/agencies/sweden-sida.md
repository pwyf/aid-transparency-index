Development cooperation in Sweden is overseen by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and implemented by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA). Sweden-SIDA was a founder member of IATI in 2008 and has co-hosted the IATI Secretariat since 2013 as part of a consortium with UNDP, UNOPS and Development Initiatives. It was one of the first organisations to publish IATI data in November 2011.

Sweden-SIDA is now in the 'good' category.

Sweden-SIDA publishes on a monthly basis to the IATI Registry.

Most of the information captured in the Index is available on the IATI Registry, however for some indicators no updated information could be found. It was however available on the organisation's website in most cases and has be accepted as such.

All organisational planning indicators are published to the IATI Registry but a number of documents were out of date or could not be accessed. Current versions of all these planning and strategic documents can be found on Sweden-SIDA’s website instead.

All financial and budgetary information is made available in an open and comparable format, apart from capital spend. Sweden-SIDA does particularly well for disbursement and expenditures as well as commitments. However, there is room for improvement in the provision of forward looking budgets as well as more detailed project budgets.

Sweden-SIDA does well on all of the project attributes indicators, except for planned dates and sub-national location which are two of the lowest scoring indicators.

Sweden-SIDA performs well on joining-up development indicators, namely aid type, flow type, finance type, tied aid status and conditions. However, no current contracts and tenders could be found on the IATI Registry. Contracts can consistently be found elsewhere while tenders cold be found sometimes.

Sweden-SIDA scores on all performance indicators but project reviews and evaluations. Current reviews and evaluations are sometimes published in other formats. While available in the IATI format, objectives, pre-project impact appraisals and results are among the lowest scoring indicators.

 * Sweden-SIDA should ensure that its IATI data is kept up-to-date and made accessible for users, along with other major international donors' data.
 * Sweden-SIDA should make further improvement to provide forward-looking financial and budgetary information, at the organisation and project levels. 
 * It should make efforts to publish more sub-national location information of its projects as well as other low scoring indicators such as results and pre-project impact appraisals.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Sweden-SIDA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
