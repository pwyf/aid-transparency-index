Development cooperation in Sweden is overseen by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and implemented by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). Sida was a founder member of IATI in 2008 and has co-hosted the IATI Secretariat since 2013 as part of a consortium with UNDP, UNOPS and Development Initiatives. It was one of the first organiations to publish IATI data in November 2011.

Sweden-SIDA is now in the good category. 

Sweden-SIDA publishes on a monthly basis to the IATI registry.

 While most indicators are published in the IATI Standard, the quality of the information provided needs further improvement as eight indicators failed to meet the definition of the indicators.

Sweden-SIDA does well on all of the project attributes indicators, except planned dates and sub-national location which score comparatively low.   

All organisational planning indicators are published to IATI but the allocation policy, the audit and the country strategies provided are out of date and the procurement policy is not accessible. However, current versions of all these documents can be found on SIDA’s website. 

SIDA performs well on joined-up development indicators, namely aid type, flow type, finance type, tied aid status and conditions. However, contracts and tenders published to IATI were out of date. Contracts could be found elsewhere while tenders are not consistently available. 

Financial and budgetary information is provided in a comparable format, apart from capital spend. Sweden does well for disbursement and expenditures as well as commitments. Disaggregated budgets, project budgets and project budget documents are areas where there is room for improvement. 

SIDA scores on all performance indicators but reviews and evaluations. The documents for this indicator in the IATI format are out of date and current ones are only sometimes published in other formats. While available in the IATI format, objectives, pre-project impact appraisals and results are among the lowest scoring indicators.
