Development cooperation in Sweden is overseen by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and implemented by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). Sida was a founder member of IATI in 2008 and has co-hosted the IATI Secretariat since 2013 as part of a consortium with UNDP, UNOPS and Development Initiatives. It was one of the first organiations to publish IATI data in November 2011.

The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sweden-SIDA) is now in the good category. 

Sweden-SIDA publishes on a monthly basis to the IATI Registry.

 While most indicators are published in the IATI Standard, the quality of the information provided needs further improvement as for seven indicators no up to date information was provided. 

All organisational planning indicators are published to IATI but the allocation policy, the audit and the country strategies provided were out of date and the procurement policy was not accessible. However, current versions of all these documents can be found on Sweden-SIDA’s website. 

Financial and budgetary information is provided in the comparable IATI format, apart from capital spend. Sweden-SIDA does well for disbursement and expenditures as well as commitments. Disaggregated budgets, project budgets and project budget documents are areas where there is room for improvement. 

Sweden-SIDA does well on all of the project attributes indicators, except planned dates and sub-national location which are two of the lowest scoring indicators.   

Sweden-SIDA performs well on joined-up development indicators, namely aid type, flow type, finance type, tied aid status and conditions. However, contracts and tenders published to IATI were out of date. Contracts can consistently be found elsewhere while tenders are not consistently available. 

Sweden-SIDA scores on all performance indicators but reviews and evaluations. The documents for this indicator in the IATI format were out of date and current ones are only sometimes published in other formats. While available in the IATI format, objectives, pre-project impact appraisals and results are among the lowest scoring indicators.
