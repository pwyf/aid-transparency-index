Development cooperation in Sweden is overseen by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and implemented by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). Sida was a founder member of IATI in 2008 and has co-hosted the IATI Secretariat since 2013 as part of a consortium with UNDP, UNOPS and Development Initiatives. It was one of the first organiations to publish IATI data in November 2011.

Sweden failed to maintain its very good transparency levels and dropped from the very good category to the good category. 

Sweden, SIDA publishes all indicators on a monthly basis in IATI but data for 7 indicators is not up to date and data for one indicator does not contain the required information. 

High scores are achieved on all of the project attributes indicators except planned dates and sub-national location which score very low.   

All organisational planning indicators are published in IATI but the allocation policy, the audit and the country strategies provided are out of date and the procurement policy is not accessible. However, current versions of all these documents can be found on SIDA’s website. 

SIDA is doing well on the basic joined-up development indicators, namely aid type, flow type, finance type, tied aid status and conditions. The contracts and tenders they provide in IATI are out of date. While contracts are published in other formats, tenders are not being made available consistently. 

Financial and budgetary information is provided in a comparable format. Capital spend poses an exception as this indicator is neither published in IATI nor elsewhere. Scores for disbursement and expenditures as well as commitments are high whereas disaggregated budgets, project budgets and project budget documents reach comparatively moderate scores only. Sweden-SIDA’s total organisation budget is only forward-looking for 1 year ahead compared to two years ahead in 2016.

SIDA scores on all performance indicators but reviews and evaluations. The documents for this indicator in IATI are out of date and current ones are only sometimes published in other formats. The results documents in SIDA’s IATI data are also old but they receive points for their results data.
