The US Department of State is responsible for the implementation of US foreign policy and supports US foreign assistance programs, including those of USAID and PEPFAR. It leads on the design and implementation of the Foreign Assistance Dashboard (foreignassistance.gov) and is responsible for coordinating and publishing all US agency IATI data, excluding USAID and MCC. US-State became an IATI member in 2011. It first published to the IATI Registry in 2014.

US-State remains in the 'fair' category, of which they are at the top.

The United States publish to the IATI Registry on a quarterly basis.

All organisational planning indicators are published via US-State’s IATI data and full points are given for all but country strategies. Country strategies are only sometimes published in other formats.

Although the majority of finance and budget indicators are published in the IATI format, only capital spend scores highly. Both the commitments and disaggregated budgets indicators are among the lowest scoring indicators and the total organisation budget is forward-looking for one year ahead only. Project budgets are sometimes being made available in a PDF format whereas project budget documents are not published at all.

All project attributes are published to the IATI Registry. However, basic quality issues were identified with US-State's data and US-State scores lowest for project attributes among the US agencies. For example, titles, descriptions and sub-national location did not meet the definition of the indicators and could not be used as such. For a number of projects, dates and activity status also appeared to be incorrect.

US-State scores for all joining-up development data indicators. The IATI format information for tenders and contracts was not specific to individual activities. Yet, contracts and tenders are consistently published in other formats.

No points are given to it for any of the performance indicators. Out of the four indicators, only results are sometimes published. Reviews and evaluations, objectives and pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.

 * US-State should ensure to get the basics right, such as providing complete and non-technical titles and descriptions.
 * It should ensure that activity status and activity dates are regularly updated and stated correctly.
 * It should prioritise the comprehensive publication of key documents such as country strategies, evaluations and pre-project impact appraisals. 
 * It should develop a standard foreign assistance management and business process, which would ensure accuracy and consistency of the data published across Bureaus.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, US-State should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
