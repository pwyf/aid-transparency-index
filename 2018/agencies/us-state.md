The US Department of State is responsible for the implementation of US foreign policy and supports US foreign assistance programs, including those of USAID and PEPFAR. It leads on the design and implementation of the Foreign Assistance Dashboard (foreignassistance.gov) and is responsible for coordinating and publishing all US agency IATI data, excluding USAID. The Department of State became an IATI member in 2011. It first published to the IATI Registry in 2014.

The United States Department of State (US-State) remains in the fair category, of which they are at the top. 

As with all US agencies, data is only published quarterly to the IATI Registry. 

All organisational planning indicators are published via US-State’s IATI data and full points are given for all but country strategies. Country strategies are only sometimes published in other formats. 

Although the majority of finance and budget indicators are published in the IATI format, only capital spend scores highly. Both the commitments and disaggregated budgets indicators are among the lowest scoring indicators and the total organisation budget is forward-looking for one year ahead only. Project budgets are sometimes being made available in a PDF format whereas project budget documents are not published at all. 

All project attributes are published to IATI. However, basic quality issues were identified with US-State's data and US-State scores lowest for project attributes among the US agencies. For example, titles, descriptions and sub-national location did not meet the definition of the indicators and could not be used as such. For a number of projects, dates and activity status also appeared to be wrong.

US-State scores for all joined-up development data indicators. The IATI format information for tenders and contracts was too general and not specific to individual activities. Yet, contracts and tenders are consistently published in other formats. 

No points are given to US-State for any of the performance indicators. Out of the four indicators, only results are sometimes published. Reviews and evaluations, objectives and pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.

US-State’s limitations partly result from having its data fragmented across different budget, financial, and project management systems, as well as being siloed in different individual bureau systems. The department should develop a standard foreign assistance management and business process, which would harmonize how data is recorded across Bureaus.

US-State should ensure to get the basics, such as titles and descriptions, right. Additionally, it would be beneficial to ensure that activity status and activity dates are regularly updated and stated correctly. 

US-State should prioritise the comprehensive publication of key documents such as country strategies, evaluations and pre-project impact appraisals.
