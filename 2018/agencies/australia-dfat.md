In November 2013, AusAID was integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which is now responsible for implementing Australia’s aid programme. Its aims include advancing Australia's security interests internationally and raising the living standards through reducing poverty in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia became a member of IATI in 2008 and first published IATI data in September 2011.

As in recent years, Australia, DFAT remains in the fair category.

Australia, DFAT has reduced the timeliness of their data, going from publishing quarterly to publishing every six months. 

All indicators within the project attributes component receive good scores and are published to IATI, barring sub-national location. Sub-national location information is sometimes published in other formats. 

From the organisational and planning indicators, only the annual report is published in IATI. Organisation strategy, allocation policy, procurement policy, country strategies and audit are always made available in other formats. Australia, DFAT does not have a data portal and scores 0 points for the accessibility indicator. 

Apart from tenders and contracts, all indicators of the joined-up development data component are published in a comparable format and score high. Contracts and tenders are consistently made available in other formats. 

The finance and budget indicators are all published in a comparable format. The project budget documents provided, however, do not meet the definition of the indicator and correct documents are not published in other formats. DFAT scores high for capital spend, commitments as well as disbursements and expenditures but receives less points for disaggregated budgets and project budgets. The total organisation budget is published for one year ahead only. 

DFAT has published all indicators of the performance category in IATI but none of them fulfilled the definition criteria. While objectives, reviews and evaluations as well as results are sometimes published in other formats, pre-project impact appraisals are not made available at all. As none of the performance indicators is published consistently, DFAT receives 0 points for this component.
