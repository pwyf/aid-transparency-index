In November 2013, AusAID was integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which is now responsible for implementing Australia’s aid programme. Its aims include advancing Australia's security interests internationally and raising the living standards through reducing poverty in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia became a member of IATI in 2008 and first published IATI data in September 2011.

Australia-DFAT remains in the 'fair' category. It publishes to the IATI Registry on a quarterly basis. 

Under the Organisational and planning component, information is made available on all indicators but only the annual report is published in the IATI Standard.

The finance and budget indicators are all published in the comparable IATI format. Project budget documents, however, did not meet the definition of the indicator and could not be found elsewhere. There is also room for improvement in the provision of forward-looking budgets, as Australia-DFAT provides a total organisation budget for one-year forward only and disaggregated budgets and project budgets are two of the lowest scoring indicators. 

Within the project attributes component, all indicators are published in a comparable format, barring sub-national locations. Sub-national location information is sometimes published in other formats. 

Apart from tenders and contracts, which are made available on separate websites, all indicators of the Joined-up development data component are published to the IATI Registry. 

Australia-DFAT does not score at all on performance-related information. It published data and documents on all relevant indicators in the IATI format but none of them contained the information as per indicator definition. While objectives, reviews and evaluations, as well as results, are sometimes published in other formats, pre-project impact appraisals are not made available at all.

Australia-DFAT should improve the comprehensiveness of its publication to the IATI Registry and make more information available in an open and comparable format.
In particular, it should work towards collecting and publishing performance-related information.
While doing so, it should also ensure the quality of the information published to the IATI Registry so that for example, the most up-to-date documents containing relevant information are made available. 
To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Australia-DFAT should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
