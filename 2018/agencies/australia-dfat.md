In November 2013, AusAID was integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), which is now responsible for implementing Australia’s aid programme. Its aims include advancing Australia's security interests internationally and raising the living standards through reducing poverty in the Indo-Pacific region. Australia became a member of IATI in 2008 and first published IATI data in September 2011.
