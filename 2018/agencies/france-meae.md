France, MEAE has progressed from the poor category in 2016 to the fair category this year. 

They have improved the timeliness of their data, now publishing monthly. 

France, MEAE publishes all project attributes indicators but contact details in a comparable format and receives high scores for the majority of them. One exception is actual dates which scores very low. They are among the top 5 scorers for the sub-national location indicator. 

None of the organisational and planning indicators is available in a comparable format. Although organisation strategy, annual report and country strategies are published in IATI, all documents provided are out of date. A current organisation strategy, annual report as well as both an allocation and procurement policy document are provided on the organisation’s website. However, no country strategies nor an audit are published.

France, MEAE scores full points for four indicators within the joined-up development data component: aid type, flow type, finance type and tied aid status. Contracts and tenders are sometimes provided in non-comparable formats. Conditions are not published at all. 

Only two indicators of the finance and budgets component, commitments and disbursement and expenditures, are published in IATI. Project budgets, project budget documents and capital spend are not published at all. Forward-looking budgets are provided in the form of pdf documents. While the total organisation budget gives an outlook for at least three years ahead, the disaggregated budgets are for 1-year ahead. 

France, MEAE does not score on any of the performance indicators. While objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are published sometimes, pre-project impact appraisals and results are not being made available.
