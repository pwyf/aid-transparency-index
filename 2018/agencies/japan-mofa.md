title: Japan â€“ Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
short_name: Japan, MOFA
---

The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is responsible for setting Japan's foreign and development policy and holds jurisdiction over the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Japan is an influential player in global development as a member of the G7, the G20, and the joint largest shareholder in the Asian Development Bank. Japan is not an IATI member and MOFA does not publish IATI data.

The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan-MOFA) remains in the very poor category. It is not publishing to the IATI Registry and thus none of its data is available in a comparable format. 

Information is consistently published for only eight indicators, for 10 indicators some information is available and no information at all is available for 16 indicators. 

Japan-MOFA scores on half of the indicators for the organisational planning and commitments components. A current annual report and a procurement policy are published on their website and country strategies, audits and allocation policies are made available but were not up to date. No organisation strategy is provided on Japan-MOFA's website. 

For the joined-up development data component, Japan-MOFA provides information about finance type and flow type consistently. Information about the aid type and tied aid status can be found for some projects. No information at all is published for conditions nor are contracts and tenders being published. 

Apart from objectives, no information is being made available for any of the other performance related indicators. Reviews and evaluations are sometimes published. 

No financial and budgetary information is available but for commitments. Nor is a forward-looking total organisation budget and disaggregated budgets being published.
