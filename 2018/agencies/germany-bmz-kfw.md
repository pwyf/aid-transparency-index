As the Ministry for Economic and Development Cooperation, BMZ, plays a leadership role in setting Germany's development cooperation policies and is responsible for its IATI publication. The KFW Development Bank implements BMZ's financial cooperation, funded by a mix of public and capital market funds.  BMZ became an IATI member in 2008 and first published to IATI in March 2013.

As in 2016, BMZ-KFW remains in the fair category, two places behind BMZ-GIZ. 
BMZ-KFW improved the timeliness of its data, now publishing monthly.

Out of the five components, BMZ-KFW scores highest on project attributes, doing very well on actual and planned dates, titles, current status and sectors. Yet, project descriptions tend to be incomplete and sub-national locations are provided for some projects only. 

Current versions for all organisational planning indicators are consistently being published. However, only the organisation strategy and the procurement policy are available in a comparable format. Although the annual report, audits and country strategies are published in IATI, the documents provided do not contain the required information. The correct documents and an allocation policy can be found on KFW’s website. 

While BMZ-KFW scores highly for basic joined-up development indicators, namely aid, flow and finance type as well as conditions and tied aid status. Contracts and tenders are not published to IATI nor in other formats. 

BMZ-KFW scores above average for the finance and budgets component. Project budget information is made available in the IATI standard and the total organisation budget of BMZ-KFW is made available for at least three years ahead instead of only two years as in 2016. They also score very high on commitments as well as disaggregated budgets. Project budget documents, however, are not published in IATI and cannot be found elsewhere

BMZ-KFW does not score on any of the performance indicators. Whereas objectives, evaluations and results are sometimes being published in other formats, pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.
