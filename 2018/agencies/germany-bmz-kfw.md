As the Ministry for Economic and Development Cooperation, BMZ, plays a leadership role in setting Germany's development cooperation policies and is responsible for its IATI publication. The KFW Development Bank implements BMZ's financial cooperation, funded by a mix of public and capital market funds.  BMZ became an IATI member in 2008 and first published to IATI in March 2013.

BMZ-KFW remains in the fair category, two places behind BMZ-GIZ. 
BMZ-KFW improved the timeliness of its data, now publishing monthly.

Out of the five components, BMZ-KFW scores highest on project attributes, doing relatively well on actual and planned dates, titles, current status and sectors. Yet, KFW does not provide some of the basics such as project descriptions which tend to be incomplete. Sub-national locations are provided for some projects only on the organisation's website. 

Information for all organisational planning indicators is comprehensively available. However, there are issues with the quality of the information available. Only the organisation strategy and the procurement policy are available in a comparable format. Annual report, audits and country strategies are published in IATI but did not meet the definition. All documents are available on the organisation's website. 

While BMZ-KFW gets points for basic joined-up development indicators, namely aid, flow and finance type as well as conditions and tied aid status,  contracts and tenders are not published at all.

BMZ-KFW scores above average for the finance and budgets component. Project budget documents, however, are not published in IATI and cannot be found elsewhere

BMZ-KFW does not score on any of the performance indicators. Whereas objectives, evaluations and results are sometimes being published in other formats, pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.
