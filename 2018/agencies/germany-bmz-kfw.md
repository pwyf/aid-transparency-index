title: Germany â€“ Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development - KFW (BMZ-KFW)
short_name: Germany, BMZ-KFW
---

As the Federal Ministry for Economic and Development Cooperation, BMZ, plays a leadership role in setting Germany's development cooperation policies and is responsible for its IATI publication. The KFW Development Bank implements BMZ's financial cooperation, funded by a mix of public and capital market funds.  BMZ became an IATI member in 2008 and first published to IATI in March 2013.

BMZ-KFW remains in the fair category, two places behind BMZ-GIZ. 

BMZ-KFW has improved the frequency of its publication, now publishing monthly compared to quarterly in 2016.

Information for all organisational planning indicators is published. However, there are basic issues with the quality of the information available. Only the organisation strategy and the procurement policy are available in the IATI format. Annual report, audits and country strategies are published to the IATI Registry but did not meet the definition. All documents are available on the organisation's website. 

BMZ-KFW scores above average for the finance and budgets component. Capital spend and project budget documents, however, are not published to IATI and cannot be found elsewhere.

BMZ-KFW does well on project attributes, in particular on actual and planned dates, titles, current status and sectors. Yet, BMZ-KFW does not provide some of the basics such as project descriptions which tend to be incomplete. Sub-national locations are provided for some projects and only on the organisation's website. 

While BMZ-KFW gets points for basic joining-up development indicators, namely aid, flow and finance type as well as conditions and tied aid status. Contracts and tenders are not published at all.

BMZ-KFW does not score on any of the performance indicators. Whereas objectives, reviews and evaluations and results are sometimes being published in non-comparable formats, pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.

BMZ-KfW should ensure it gets the basics of its publication right. This includes providing relevant and up-to-date documents on organisational planning as well as providing complete descriptions of its projects. 

It shold also make further efforts to provide sub-national location information to identify where its projects are being implemented.

It should also start publishing comprehensive and consistent information on its performance, from objectives to pre-project-impact appraisals, reviews and evaluations as well as results.

To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, BMZ-KFW should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
