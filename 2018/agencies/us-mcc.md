Created by the US Congress in 2004, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an independent bilateral US foreign aid agency. It provides large-scale, multi-year grants for global poverty reduction. As part of the US government, MCC became an IATI member in 2011. It first published IATI data in January 2013.

As in previous years, US-MCC is placed in the 'Very Good' category, and is the top performing US agency. 

As with all US agencies, data is only published quarterly to the IATI registry. 

MCC is doing  well on project attributes. 

All organisational planning indicators are published in an IATI format except country strategies. These, however, are consistently published in other formats. 

US-MCC scores on all joined-up development indicators and apart from tenders all indicators are provided in a comparable format. Tenders are consistently being made available in other formats. 

There is room for improvement in the financial and budgetary component. The total organisation budget and dibursements and expenditures are the lowest scoring IATI indicators. While disaggregated budgets are available on IATI, MCC does not use the relevant country codes to specify its recipient budgets. 

Within the very good category, MCC scores below average for the performance component. While performing relatively well on objectives and pre-project impact appraisals, no results data can be found on IATI. Reviews and evaluations are not published in a comparable format but can be found in other formats.
