Created by the US Congress in 2004, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an independent bilateral US foreign aid agency. It provides large-scale, multi-year grants for global poverty reduction. As part of the US government, MCC became an IATI member in 2011. It first published IATI data in January 2013.

As in previous years, the United States Millennium Challenge Corporation (US-MCC) is placed in the very good category, and is the top performing US agency. 

As with all US agencies, data is only published quarterly to the IATI Registry. However, MCC began reporting directly to IATI rather than through the State Department's "F" Bureau. 

All organisational planning indicators are published in the comparable IATI format except country strategies. These, however, are consistently published in other formats. 

There is room for improvement in the financial and budgetary component. The total organisation budget and disbursements and expenditures are the lowest scoring IATI indicators. While disaggregated budgets are available in the IATI format, US-MCC does not use the relevant country codes to specify its recipient budgets. 

US-MCC is doing well on project attributes. It has started publishing sub-national location in a comparable format, meaning all project attributes are now available in the IATI Standard.  

US-MCC scores on all joined-up development indicators and apart from tenders all indicators are provided in a comparable format. Tenders are consistently being made available in other formats. 

Within the very good category, US-MCC scores below average for the performance component. While performing relatively well on objectives and pre-project impact appraisals, no results data but only results documents can be found in US-MCC's IATI data. Reviews and evaluations are not published in a comparable format but can be found in other formats.

US-MCC should continue its efforts to work with the MCAs to have more granular information from the sectors, and projects within the sectors, published to IATI.  


A major omission from US-MCC's IATI data is that of recipient countries / recipient regions. We would encourage US-MCC to directly declare the recipient countries in their IATI datasets.  

US-MCC should prioritise the publication of country strategies, tenders as well as reviews and evaluations in a comparable format.
