Created by the US Congress in 2004, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an independent bilateral US foreign aid agency. It provides large-scale, multi-year grants for global poverty reduction. As part of the US government, MCC became an IATI member in 2011. It first published IATI data in January 2013.

As in previous years, MCC has placed in the 'Very Good' category, and is the top performing US agency. 

As with all US agencies, data is only published quarterly to the IATI registry. 

MCC is doing very well on project attributes, receiving very high scores on all indicators of this component. 

All organisational planning indicators are published in an IATI format except country strategies. These, however, are consistently published in other formats. 

US, MCC scores on all joined-up development indicators and apart from tenders all indicators are provided in a comparable format. Tenders are consistently being made available in other formats. 

While MCC does very well on the majority of finance and budget indicators, they are doing less well on forward-looking financial data. The total organisation budget is provided for 2-years ahead only and although looking at least 3 years ahead, disaggregated budgets are not published in a comparable nor in a machine-readable format. 

Within the very good category, MCC scores below average for the performance component. While scoring high on objectives and pre-project impact appraisals, the results data published in IATI does not meet the definition. They receive points for their results documents only. Reviews and evaluations are not published in a comparable format but are consistently being made available in other formats.
