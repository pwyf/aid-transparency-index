The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark (Denmark-MFA) is in the fair category. 

Denmark-MFA publishes to the IATI Registry on a monthly basis.

All organisational planning indicators but country strategies are published via Denmark-MFA’s IATI data. However, the annual report did not meet the definition and the procurement policy was not accessible. While the procurement policy is published elsewhere, no current annual report is being made available. Country strategies are not published consistently in other formats. 

The majority of the finance and budgetary indicators are published in an IATI format and receive good scores. Disaggregated budgets are provided for three years ahead but not in a comparable format. Capital spend and project budget documents are not made available at all. 

While performing well on the majority of the project attributes indicators, Denmark-MFA’s descriptions provided in the IATI format did not include the required information, resulting in a lower score for this indicator. There is further room for improvement on the planned dates indicator. Data about implementers is only made available sometimes whereas sub-national location information is not published at all. 

Denmark-MFA does well on four of the joined-up development data indicators, namely aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. Tenders, contracts and conditions are not published to IATI. Only tenders are consistently being made available in other formats, contracts and conditions information is not published. 

Denmark-MFA does not receive any points for the performance component. Objectives and results are published to IATI but the information did not meet the definitions of these indicators. Both objectives and results are made available in other formats but this is not done consistently. The same applies for pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations which are only made available sometimes.
