Denmark-MFA is in the poor category. 

Denmark publishes to the IATI registry on a monthly basis.

While scoring high on the majority of the project attributes indicators, Denmark’s descriptions provided in the IATI format do not include the required information. 
Data about implementers is only made available sometimes whereas sub-national location information is not published at all. 

Denmark scores high on four of the joined-up development data indicators, namely aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. Tenders, contracts and conditions are not published to IATI. Only tenders are consistently being made available in other formats, contracts and conditions information is not published. 

All organisational planning indicators but country strategies are published via Denmark’s IATI data. However, there is room for improvement with regards to the quality of the information made available as some indicators did not meet the definition. While the procurement policy is published elsewhere, no current annual report is being made available. Country strategies are not published consistently. 

All indicators within the finance and budgets component are published in a comparable format and score comparatively high, with the exception of disaggregated budgets and project budget documents which are not available at all. 
Denmark does not receive any points for the performance component. Objectives and results are published to IATI but the information does not meet the definitions of these indicators. Both objectives and results are made available in other formats but this is not done consistently. The same applies for pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations which are only made available sometimes.
