The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark is responsible for Denmark's development cooperation to which it refers to as Danida. Denmark became an IATI member in 2008 and started publishing to IATI in March 2012.

Denmark dropped this year, and are now in the poor category, down from good in 2016. 

Denmark publishes to the IATI registry on a monthly basis.

While scoring high on the majority of the project attributes indicators, Denmark’s descriptions provided in IATI do not include the required information. 
Data about implementers is only made available sometimes whereas sub-national location information is not published at all. 

Denmark scores high on four of the joined-up development data indicators, namely aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. Tenders, contracts and conditions are not published in IATI. Only tenders are consistently being made available in other formats, contracts and conditions information is not published. 

All organisational planning indicators but country strategies are published via Denmark’s IATI data. However, the information on the annual report is insufficient and the procurement policy provided is not accessible. While the procurement policy is published elsewhere, no current annual report is being made available. Country strategies are not published consistently. 

All indicators within the finance and budgets component are published in a comparable format and score high, with the exception of disaggregated budgets and project budget documents. The latter are not published in other formats either. Disaggregated budgets are available for at least 3-years ahead in PDF format. 

Denmark does not receive any points for the performance component. Objectives and results are published in IATI but the information does not meet the definitions of these indicators. Both objectives and results are made available in other formats but this is not done consistently. The same goes for pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations which are only being made available sometimes.
