The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is responsible for Norway's development cooperation. The Index takes into account information published by the MFA and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). The majority of Norwegian development assistance is administered by the MFA but some activity-level information is found on the Norad website. Norway is not an IATI member but started publishing to IATI in December 2015.

Norway should improve the comprehensiveness of its publication, to include more financial and budgetary information. 

It should also prioritise the publication of performance-related information, from objectives to results. 

To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Norway-MFA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
