The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is responsible for Norway's development cooperation. The Index takes into account information published by the MFA and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). The majority of Norwegian development assistance is administered by the MFA but some activity-level information is found on the Norad website. Norway is not an IATI member but started publishing to IATI in December 2015.
