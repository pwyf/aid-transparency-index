The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is responsible for Norway's development cooperation. The Index takes into account information published by the MFA and Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). The majority of Norwegian development assistance is administered by the MFA but some activity-level information is found on the Norad website. Norway is not an IATI member but started publishing to IATI in December 2015.

- Commitments, disbursements and expenditures are published to IATI for almost all activities. However, project budgets no longer published to IATI, and total budget is only provided for the current year.
- Norway scores well for project attributes, but there are some big omissions in their data. Actual end dates are never provided, and while planned dates are sometimes provided, they’re not available in IATI data.
- Norway scores 0 for the performance component. Objectives, reviews and evaluations and results are all sometimes published; impact appraisals are not published.
