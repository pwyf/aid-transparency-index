The Department of Defense works to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives, a number of which are foreign assistance-related in approach. Such operations typically work to train, equip and support foreign defense and security establishments under a discrete set of circumstances. Like the other US agencies, the Department of Defense became an IATI member in 2011. It first published to the IATI Registry in May 2013.

The United States Department of Defense (US-Defense) remains in the middle of the fair category and is the worst performing US agency.

Like all other US agencies, the US-Defense publishes to the IATI Registry on a quarterly basis. 

All organisational planning indicators apart from annual report and country strategies are available on the IATI Registry. No alternative is available in other formats. 

US-Defense performs below average with regards to finances and budgets. It publishes capital spend, commitments as well as disbursements and expenditures in the IATI standard. Disbursements and expenditures, however, is one of the lowest scoring indicators. While project budget documents are sometimes published, project budgets cannot be found. Neither is forward-looking finance data in the form of total organisation and disaggregated budgets available. 

US-Defense performs well on the majority of project attributes, publishing all of them to IATI. However, it needs to work on some of the basics. For example, titles include too many acronyms and descriptions tend to be incomplete. Dates of existing projects do not seem to be accurate. Sub-national locations provided to IATI did not contain the required information and are not available in other formats either. 

All joined-up development data indicators are published in the comparable IATI format. However, the information provided for contracts and tenders was too general and not specific to individual activities. While contracts are consistently provided in other formats, tenders are only published sometimes. 

US-Defense does not receive any points for the performance component. Objectives are sometimes published but results, pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are not published at all.

US-DOD should regularly update its data to ensure that dates and activity statuses are correct, as these are critical first steps for people to understand what projects are being implemented and which are closed. 
It should also add project descriptions and improve its financial and budgetary transparency, including project budgets. 
US-DOD should further ensure that both activity dates and activity statuses are regularly updated and stated correctly. 
US-DOD should prioritise the publication of key documents, for example country strategies as well as pre-project impact appraisals and evaluations.
