The Department of Defense works to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives, a number of which are foreign assistance-related in approach. Such operations typically work to train, equip and support foreign defense and security establishments under a discrete set of circumstances. Like the other US agencies, the Department of Defense became an IATI member in 2011. It first published to the IATi Registry in May 2013.

As in 2016, the US Department of Defense remains in the middle of the fair category, remaining the worst performing US agency.

Like all other US agencies, the US, Defense publishes to the IATI registry on a monthly basis. 

US, Defense performs well on the majority of project attributes, publishing all of them in IATI. However, titles include too many acronyms and descriptions tend to be incomplete, resulting in a lower score for these indicators. Sub-national locations provided do not contain the required information and are not available in other formats either. 

All organisational planning indicators apart from annual report and country strategies score full points. Annual report information is published in IATI but does not fulfil the given definition. No alternative is available in other formats, nor are country strategies. 

All joined-up development data indicators are published in a comparable format. However, the information provided for contracts and tenders is too general and not specific to individual activities. While contracts are consistently provided in other formats, tenders are only published sometimes. 

US, Defense performs well below average with regards to finances and budgets. They publish and score for three indicators only: capital spend, commitments as well as disbursements and expenditures. While project budget documents are sometimes published, project budgets cannot be found. Neither is forward-looking finance data in the form of total organisation and disaggregated budgets available. 

US, Defense does not receive any points for the performance component. Objectives are sometimes published but results, pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are not published at all.
