The Department of Defense works to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United States to achieve strategic objectives, a number of which are foreign assistance-related in approach. Such operations typically work to train, equip and support foreign defense and security establishments under a discrete set of circumstances. Like the other US agencies, the Department of Defense became an IATI member in 2011. It first published to the IATi Registry in May 2013.

The US Department of Defense remains in the middle of the fair category and is the worst performing US agency.

Like all other US agencies, the US-Defense publishes to the IATI registry on a monthly basis. 

US-Defense performs well on the majority of project attributes, publishing all of them in IATI. However, it needs to work on some of the basics. For example, titles include too many acronyms and descriptions tend to be incomplete. Dates of existing projects do not seem to be accurate. Sub-national locations provided to IATI  do not contain the required information and are not available in other formats either. 

All organisational planning indicators apart from annual report and country strategies are available on the IATI Registry. No alternative is available in other formats. 

All joined-up development data indicators are published in a comparable format. However, the information provided for contracts and tenders is too general and not specific to individual activities. While contracts are consistently provided in other formats, tenders are only published sometimes. 

US-Defense performs  below average with regards to finances and budgets. While project budget documents are sometimes published, project budgets cannot be found. Neither is forward-looking finance data in the form of total organisation and disaggregated budgets available. 

US-Defense does not receive any points for the performance component. Objectives are sometimes published but results, pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are not published at all.
