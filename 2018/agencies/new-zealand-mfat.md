The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) is responsible for the New Zealand Aid Programme, which covers development cooperation and provides humanitarian support in natural disasters and conflict. New Zealand became an IATI member in 2008 and MFAT began publishing IATI data in July 2013.

This is New Zealand, MFAT's first year being included in the Index. They now sit at the very bottom of the poor category. 

New Zealand currently only publishes to the IATI registry less than quarterly. 

The majority of project attributes are published in an IATI format and score well. However, information about implementers is only provided sometimes and sub-national locations are not published. 

None of the organisational planning indicators was published in IATI but all except country strategies are published in other formats. Country strategies documentation are not being made available consistently. 

Within the joined-up development data component, conditions, tenders and contracts are not published in IATI. Conditions are not published, contracts are sometimes published and tenders are consistently being made available in other formats

A mere two finance and budget indicators, project budget and disbursements and expenditures, are published in a comparable format with project budget also scoring very low. Capital spend and project budget documents are not being made available whereas commitments can sometimes be found. The total organisation budget and disaggregated budgets is only available one year ahead, and not in a machine-readable format.

New Zealand scores 0 for the performance component. While objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are sometimes published, pre-project impact appraisals and results are not provided at all.
