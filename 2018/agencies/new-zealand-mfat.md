The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) is responsible for the New Zealand Aid Programme, which covers development cooperation and provides humanitarian support in natural disasters and conflict. New Zealand became an IATI member in 2008 and MFAT began publishing IATI data in July 2013.

The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand-MFAT) sits at the bottom of the poor category. 

New Zealand-MFAT currently only publishes to the IATI Registry less than quarterly. 

None of the organisational planning indicators was published to IATI but all except country strategies are published in other formats. Country strategies documentation are not being made available consistently. 

Two finance and budget indicators, project budget as well as disbursements and expenditures, are published in a comparable format with project budget scoring comparatively low. Capital spend and project budget documents are not being made available whereas commitments can sometimes be found. The total organisation budget and disaggregated budgets are only available one year ahead and in a PDF format. 

The majority of project attributes indicators is published in the comparable IATI format and New Zealand-MFAT performs relatively well on the majority of them. However, information about implementers is only provided sometimes on the organisation's website and sub-national locations are not published. 

Within the joined-up development data component, conditions are not published while contracts are sometimes published and tenders are consistently being made available in non-comparable formats. 

New Zealand-MFAT does not receive any points for the performance component. While objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are sometimes published, pre-project impact appraisals and results are not provided at all.

New Zealand-MFAT should aim for quarterly, if not monthly publication.

New Zealand -MFAT shold pblish an organisation file to the IATI Registry and include all relevant strategy and planning indicators

New Zealand should improve its ublication of financial and budgetary data to include forward looking organisation and disaggregated budgets as well as project budget information.

It should also pioritise the publication of performance-related informatio, including pre-project impact appraisals and results. 

To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, New Zealand-MFA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
