The Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR) is responsible for the European Union (EU) enlargement policies and its relations with neighbouring countries. It manages the bulk of the EU’s financial and technical assistance to these countries. The European Commission became an IATI member in 2008 and DG NEAR began publishing to IATI in September 2013.

EC-NEAR remains in the good category. 

EC-NEAR publishes monthly and provides 88% of the indicators in the IATI format which is the highest percentage among the EC agencies. 

Among the EC agencies, NEAR is the agency which receives the highest score on the finance and budget component. They are the only EC agency to publish project budget documents, although the score for this indicator is comparatively low. There is also room for improvement on disaggregated budgets. 

EC-NEAR performs comparatively well on the majority of project attributes indicators, all published in a comparable format. Scores for implementer and sub-national location in particular remain comparatively low. 

EC-NEAR performs generally well on basic joined-up development data indicators such as aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. However, no current tenders could be found in the IATI format. These are available on the organisation’s website. Contracts are not published at all.

Three out of four indicators within the performance component, namely results, pre-project impact appraisals and objectives are published in a comparable format but they all receive low scores. Reviews and evaluations are not provided in the IATI format and are only sometimes published in other formats.
