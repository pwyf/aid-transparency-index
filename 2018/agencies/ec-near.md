The Directorate-General for Neighbourhood and Enlargement Negotiations (DG NEAR) is responsible for the European Union (EU) enlargement policies and its relations with neighbouring countries. It manages the bulk of the EU’s financial and technical assistance to these countries. The European Commission became an IATI member in 2008 and DG NEAR began publishing to IATI in September 2013.

EC, NEAR remains in the good category. After being the leader among the EC agencies in 2016, EC, NEAR loses its top spot to EC, ECHO and ranks second before EC, DEVCO. 

EC, NEAR publishes monthly and provides 88% of the indicators in an IATI format which is the highest percentage among the EC agencies. 

Among the EC agencies, NEAR is the agency which receives the highest score on the finance and budget component. EC, NEAR has started publishing capital spend in a comparable format and delivers very good commitments as well as disbursements and expenditures data. They are the only EC agency to publish project budget documents, although the score for this indicator is comparatively low. They further score low on disaggregated budgets. 

EC, NEAR performs well on the majority of project attributes indicators, publishing all in a comparable format. Scores for implementer and in particular sub-national location are comparatively low. 

Three out of four indicators within the performance component, namely results, pre-project impact appraisals and objectives are published in a comparable format but they all receive low scores. Reviews and evaluations are not provided in an IATI format and are only sometimes published in other formats. 

High scores are achieved on basic joined-up development data indicators such as aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. Since only conditions documents and no conditions data are being published in IATI, NEAR scores low on this indicator. Tenders are made available in IATI but are not up to date. Current documents are consistently being published on the organisation’s website. Contracts are not published at all.

Among the three EC agencies, NEAR scores lowest on organisational planning and commitments as the allocation policy provided in IATI does not meet the definition and consistent information cannot be found elsewhere.
