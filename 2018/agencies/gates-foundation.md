The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the world.

It became an IATI member in 2013 and published its first IATI data in March 2014.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation remains in the fair category.

The Gates Foundation publishes less than quarterly to the IATI Registry. 

All organisational planning indicators, except for country strategies, are published to IATI. However, the organisation strategy provided did not meet the definition. Country strategies can only be found sometimes on the organisation's website. 

The Gates Foundation scores slightly below average for the finance and budgets component. Capital spend, disbursements and expenditures, commitments, project budgets and total organisation budget are published in a comparable format. No forward-looking disaggregated budgets are available. Neither are project budget documents published.

The Gates Foundation performs well on providing basic information on projects. It publishes all indicators of the project attributes component in the comparable IATI format. However, the sub-national location information provided did not meet the definition of this indicator and is not published in other formats. 

Within the joined-up development data, five indicators are published to the IATI Registry: aid type, flow type, finance type, tied aid status and tenders. The tenders provided were not specific to individual activities but are consistently published in other formats. Contracts are sometimes made available on the organisation's website and no information is provided for conditions. 

Within the performance component, the Gates Foundation only scores on objectives. The data provided to IATI for this indicator did not fulfil the definition but the information is made available in other formats. Reviews and evaluations are also published to IATI but did not meet the definition either. No alternatives are available in other formats. Results as well as pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.

The Gates Foundation should aim for quarterly, if not monthly publication.
