The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation remains in the fair category.

The Gates Foundation publishes less than quarterly to the IATI registry. 

The Gates Foundation performs well on providing basic information on projects. It publishes all indicators of the project attributes component in a comparable format. However, the sub-national location information provided does not meet the definition of this indicator and is not published in other formats. 

All organisational planning indicators, except for country strategies, are published to IATI. However, the organisation strategy published in the IATI format did not meet the definition. Country strategies can only be found sometimes on the organisation's website. 

Within the joined-up development data, five indicators are published to the IATI registry: aid type, flow type, finance type, tied aid status and tenders. Tenders made available in the IATI standard but are not specific to individual activities. Those can be found in other formats. Contracts are sometimes made available on the organisation's website and no information is provided for conditions. 

The Gates Foundation scores slightly below average for the finance and budgets component. Capital spend, disbursements and expenditures, commitments, project budgets and total organisation budget are published in the IATI format. No forward-looking disaggregated budgets are available.  Neither are project budget documents published.

Within the performance component, the Gates Foundation only scores on objectives. The data provided to IATI for this indicator does not fulfil the definition but the information is made available in other formats. Reviews and evaluations are also published to IATI but did not meet the definition. No alternatives are available in other formats. Results as well as pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.

The Gates Foundation should aim for quarterly, if not monthly publication.
