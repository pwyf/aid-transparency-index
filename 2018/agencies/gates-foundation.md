The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the world. It provides grants to support initiatives in education, global health and development and community giving in the Pacific Northwest. It became an IATI member in 2013 and published its first IATI data in March 2014.

After initial progress in earlier years, the Gates Foundation has stagnated, remaining in the fair category.

The Gates Foundationâ€™s data lacks timeliness as they publish less than quarterly to the IATI registry. 

The Gates Foundation publishes all indicators of the project attributes component in a comparable format. However, the sub-national location information provided does not meet the definition of this indicator. Sub-national locations are not published in other formats. 

Five organisational planning indicators are published in IATI: organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy, procurement policy and audit. But the data provided for organisation strategy in IATI does not contain the required information. Some information about the organisation strategy and some country strategies are published in other formats.

Within the joined-up development data, five indicators are published in IATI: aid type, flow type, finance type, tied aid status and tenders. The tender data published is too general and not specific to individual activities. Yet, tenders are consistently published in other formats. Contracts are sometimes made available and no information is provided for conditions. 

The Gates Foundation scores slightly below average for the finance and budgets component. Capital spend, disbursements and expenditures, commitments, project budgets and total organisation budget are published to IATI. While the total organisation budget is forward-looking for one year, no forward-looking disaggregated budgets are available.  Neither are project budget documents published.

Within the performance component, the Gates Foundation only scores on objectives. The data provided in IATI for this indicator does not fulfil the definition but the information is consistently made available in other formats. Reviews and evaluations are also published in the comparable format but the information is too general and not specific to individual activities. No alternatives are available in other formats and results as well as pre-project impact appraisals are not published at all.
