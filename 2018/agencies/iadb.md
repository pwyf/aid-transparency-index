- The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) remain in the very good category from 2016, retaining 7th position
- They have increased their frequency of publication, now publishing on at least a monthly basis (previously quarterly)
- Their allocation policies were not accessible, meaning their rank for the organisational planning component was relatively low
- Project budgets are only sometimes available, and only ever annually, so their finance and budgets component was also weak.
- Since 2016, they have started providing planned start dates in their IATI data. As such, despite failing sampling for sub-national locations, they still rank high on the project attributes component
- IADB continue to publish conditions and contracts data in their IATI publications, but for a smaller proportion of activities than in 2016. Similarly, tenders are provided for small proportion of activities.
- Results data is occasionally provided in their IATI publication. Reviews and evaluations were not deemed to meet the definition for the indicator.
