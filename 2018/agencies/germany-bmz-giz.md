BMZ-GIZ remains in the good category, taking the last place within this category. 

It has improved its publication frequency, going from quarterly to monthly publications. 

Within the organisational and planning component, BMZ-GIZ scores full points for organisation strategy, procurement policy and audit. The annual report and country strategies are published in the comparable IATI format but they did not contain the required information or were not up to date. Country strategies are not consistently provided in other formats. While not in a comparable format, the allocation policy is available on the organisation's website. 

BMZ-GIZ scores above average for the finance and budgets component. Project budgets are now published in the IATI Standard and BMZ-GIZ performs well on total organisation budget, commitments, disbursements and expenditures, and disaggregated budgets. However, no information on capital spend nor project budget documents is being made available. 

BMZ-GIZ is doing well on all project attributes indicators expect sub-national location. This indicator is not published to IATI and only sometimes made available in other formats. 

They perform well on the joined-up development data component, scoring on all indicators. Contracts and tenders are not provided in the IATI format but are consistently published in other formats. 

BMZ-GIZ is one of two organisations within the good category which does not score on any of the indicators of the performance components. While results, evaluations and objectives are sometimes published, pre-project impact appraisals are not being made available at all.
