---

As the Federal Ministry for Economic and Development Cooperation, BMZ, plays a leadership role in setting Germany's development cooperation policies and is responsible for its IATI publication. GIZ is a state-owned company and implements the majority of BMZ's technical development cooperation. BMZ became an IATI member in 2008 and first published to IATI in March 2013.

BMZ-GIZ remains in the good category, taking the last place within this category. 

It has improved its publication frequency, going from quarterly to monthly publication. 

Within the organisational and planning component, BMZ-GIZ scores full points for organisation strategy, procurement policy and audit. The annual report and country strategies are published in an IATI format but did not contain the required information or were not up to date. Country strategies are not consistently provided in other formats. The allocation policy is available on the organisation's website. 

BMZ-GIZ scores above average for the finance and budgets component. Project budgets are now published in the IATI Standard and BMZ-GIZ performs well on total organisation budget, commitments, disbursements and expenditures, and disaggregated budgets. However, no information on capital spend nor project budget documents is being made available. 

BMZ-GIZ is doing well on all project attributes indicators expect sub-national location. This indicator is not published to IATI and only sometimes made available in other formats. 

They perform well on the joining-up development data component, scoring on all indicators. Contracts and tenders are not provided in the IATI format but are consistently published in other formats. 

BMZ-GIZ is one of two organisations within the good category which does not score on any of the indicators of the performance components. While results, evaluations and objectives are sometimes published, pre-project impact appraisals are not being made available at all.

BMZ-GIZ should ensure that its organisation planning ingormation on IATI is kept up-to-date and contain the right information. 

BMZ-GIZ should also start publishing information on sub-national locations to provide data on where it is implementing development work. 

It should also prioritise the publication of performance related information that allows everyone to monitor progress and whether objectives were met. 

To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, BMZ-GIZ should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
