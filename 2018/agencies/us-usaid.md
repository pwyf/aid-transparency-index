The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead development agency in the US and is the largest bilateral aid agency in the world. It works to end extreme poverty in over 100 countries. It became an IATI member in 2011 and published data jointly with other US agencies from 2013. In 2017, USAID began publishing its own data seperately.

The US Agency for International Development (US-USAID) are included in the good category. 

As with all US agencies, data is only published quarterly to the IATI registry. 

USAID does very well on the organisational planning component, scoring full points for organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy, procurement policy, audit and country strategies. 

All project attributes indicators are published in a comparable format and receive high scores. The only notable exception is for sub-national location which is among the lowest scoring indicators. 

Information on joined-up development data indicators is generally available but for the two procurement indicators, contracts and tenders. While published in the IATI format, tenders score very low. Contracts provided in the IATI standard did not meet the definition but could be found in other formats. 

Four out of three finance and budget indicators are published in the IATI format: commitments, disbursements and expenditures, disaggregated budgets and total organisation budget. The score for disaggregated budgets is moderate and the total organisation budget is provided for one year ahead only. Capital spend, project budget and project budget documents are not published. 

Although all performance indicators are published to IATI, scores for all four are low. Objectives and pre-project impact appraisals are provided in the IATI format but for a limited number of projects, leading to low scores. The reviews and evaluations as well as the results provided in the IATI format are out of date or do not meet the definition of the indicator. However, information for both indicators is consistently published in other formats.
