The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead development agency in the US and is the largest bilateral aid agency in the world. It works to end extreme poverty in over 100 countries. It became an IATI member in 2011 and published data jointly with other US agencies from 2013. In 2017, USAID began publishing its own data seperately.

USAID have made good progress this year, and are included in the good category for the first time, up from fair in every previous year. 

As with all US agencies, data is only published quarterly to the IATI registry. 

USAID does very well on the organisational planning component, scoring full points for organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy, procurement policy, audit and country strategies. 

All project attributes indicators are published in a comparable format and receive high scores, except sub-national location which scores very low. 

High scores are achieved for all of the joined-up development data indicators but the two procurement indicators, contracts and tenders. The number of tenders provided in a comparable format is limited, resulting in a low score for this indicator. The contracts provided in IATI are out of date but current ones are always being made available in other formats. 

Four out of three finance and budget indicators are published in an IATI format: commitments, disbursements and expenditures, disaggregated budgets and total organisation budget. The score for disaggregated budgets is moderate and the total organisation budget is provided for one year ahead only. Capital spend, project budget and project budget documents are not published. 

Although all performance indicators are published in IATI, scores for all four are low. Objectives and pre=project impact appraisals are provided in an IATI format but for a limited number of projects, leading to low scores. The reviews and evaluations as well as the results provided in IATI are out of date or do not meet the definition of the indicator. However, information for both indicators is consistently published in other formats.
