The US Agency for International Development (USAID) is the lead development agency in the US and is the largest bilateral aid agency in the world. It works to end extreme poverty in over 100 countries. It became an IATI member in 2011 and published data jointly with other US agencies from 2013. In 2017, USAID began publishing its own data separately.

US-USAID is included in the 'good' category.

US-USAID is now publishing directly to the IATI Registry, allowing it to post more quickly and correct its own data.

The United States publish to the IATI Registry on a quarterly basis.

US-USAID performs well on the organisational planning component, scoring full points for organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy, procurement policy, audit and country strategies.

Four out of seven finance and budget indicators are published in the IATI format: commitments, disbursements and expenditures, disaggregated budgets and total organisation budget. There is room for improvement with regards to the disaggregated budgets indicator and the total organisation budget is provided for one year ahead only. While project budgets are sometimes made available, capital spend and project budget documents are not published.

US-USAID performs well on almost all project attributes indicators and all are published in the comparable IATI format. The only notable exception is for sub-national location which is among the lowest scoring indicators. Some probable errors with activity dates and activity statuses were detected.

Information on joining-up development data indicators is generally available but for the two procurement indicators, contracts and tenders. While published in a comparable format, tenders is one of the lowest scoring indicators. Contracts provided in the IATI Standard were out of date but current ones could be found in other formats.

With regards to performance-related information, while pre-project impact appraisals and objectives are published in the IATI format, they receive low scores and could be published more comprehensively. The reviews and evaluations as well as the results provided in the IATI format were out of date or did not meet the definition of the indicator. However, information for both indicators is consistently published in other formats.

 * US-USAID should ensure that activity dates as well as activity status are regularly updated and stated correctly.
 * It should ensure that the information provided on multi-country programmes in particular is consistent in the data and documents available.
 * In addition to continued improvements on these data sets, US-USAID should also focus on systematically publishing other information, such as co-operative agreements and contracts, which contain significant and useful information.
 * US-USAID should prioritize the implementation of its Development Information Solution (DIS), allowing it to coherently consolidate, share, and use the full breath of its aid information.
 * To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, US-USAID should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish: internally, to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally, to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country-level.
