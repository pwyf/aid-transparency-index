- The Department of International Development of the United Kingdom (UK-DFID) remain in the very good category from 2016, but progress from 4th to 3rd position overall
- They continue to publish on at least a monthly basis
- As a result of the change in methodology, UK, DFID score far lower on country strategies/MoUs than in 2016. Despite this, they still rank first overall in the organisational planning and commitments component
- UK, DFID now publish to IATI for all indicators. In 2016, disaggregated budgets weren’t published to IATI, but these are now provided for some countries. (Again, the score may be lower than expected due to the change in methodology)
- UK, DFID provide evaluations for a greater proportion of their activities than in 2016, and they’re among a small number of organisations to score highly on the performance component
- However, their sub-national locations were either not provided or did not meet our definition. As a result, project attributes was their weakest component
