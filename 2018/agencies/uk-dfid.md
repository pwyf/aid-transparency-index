- The Department of International Development of the United Kingdom (UK-DFID) remains in the very good category
- They continue to publish on at least a monthly basis
- UK-DFID ranks first overall in the organisational planning and commitments component as all information is provided and made available in an open and comparable format on the IATI Registry.  

UK-DFID also makes all financial and budgetary information available on IATI, although there is room for improvement in the provision of project level budgets. 

UK-DFID does comparatively well on all project attributes indicators. While implementers are published on the IATI Registry, they do not appear to be published to the same extent as other pieces of information in this component. Sub-national locations could not consistently be found on the IATI Registry but are available on the organisation's website. 

UK-DFID also does comparatively well on joining up development data. However, there is room for improvement in the provision of contracts and tenders. 

With regards to perfomance related information, UK-DFID is one of the best performing organisations as it provides information on all indicator. Results cold be provided more comprehensively.

UK-DFID should prioritise the pblication of sub-national locations to the IATI Registry.

It should make further improvements to its publication of contacts and tenders as well as results. 

To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, UK-DFID should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness across UK departments and with country offices; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
