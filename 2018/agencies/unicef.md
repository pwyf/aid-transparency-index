The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is now included in the good category. 

UNICEF publishes IATI data on a monthly basis. 

While all indicators are published in the IATI format, for some, quality issues were noticed as the information provided for example lacked granularity. 

UNICEF performs well for all the indicators within the organisational planning component, namely organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy, audit, procurement policy and country strategies. 

They also perform well on all project attributes indicators but sub-national location which is provided in the IATI format but does not contain the required information. Sub-national location information, however, is consistently published in other formats. 

UNICEF does generally well for the joined-up development indicators except for conditions and the procurement indicators, contracts and tenders. General information only is provided to the IATI registry. This information however is available in other formats.
 
UNICEF performs well on all finance and budget indicators but project budget documents. These documents are published to IATI but are general documents and not specific to individual projects. They can only sometimes be found in other formats. 

UNICEF receives points for half of the indicators within the performance component. They have started publishing objectives in the IATI format and score for results documents. Their results data is missing and information for the two other performance indicators, evaluations and pre-project impact appraisals, did not meet the definitions. While reviews and evaluations are provided for some of UNICEFâ€™s projects, no information at all is available for pre-project impact appraisals.
