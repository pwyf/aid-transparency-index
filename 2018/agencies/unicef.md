UNICEF is the United Nations agency responsible for children, with offices in over 190 countries. UNICEF became an IATI member in 2012 and first published IATI data in 2013. UNICEF has been represented on the IATI Governing Board since 2016.

UNICEF failed to maintain its very good aid transparency level and dropped down to the good category. 

On a monthly basis, UNICEF publishes all indicators to IATI but for 5 indicators the information provided does not meet the definition as it is not granular and disaggregated enough. 

UNICEF scores highly for all the indicators within the organisational planning component, namely organisation strategy, annual report, allocation policy, audit, procurement policy and country strategies. 

They score full points on all project attributes indicators but sub-national location which is provided in an IATI format but does not contain the required information. Sub-national location information, however, is consistently published in other formats. 

UNICEF scores full points for the joined-up development data indicators except for conditions and the procurement indicators, contracts and tenders. While conditions data is provided, the respective conditions documents published to IATI are not specific to individual activities and provide general information only. The same is true for both contracts and tenders. But these are always made available in other formats.
 
UNICEF is now providing the total organisation budget for three years ahead and performs well on all finance and budget indicators but project budget documents. These documents are published to IATI but are general documents and not specific to individual activities. They can only sometimes be found in other formats. 

UNICEF receives points for half of the indicators within the performance component. They have started publishing objectives in an IATI format and score for results documents. Their results data does not contain results information and information for the two other performance indicators, evaluations and pre-project impact appraisals, is too general and not specific to individual activities. While reviews and evaluations are provided for some of UNICEFâ€™s projects, no information at all is available for pre-project impact appraisals.
