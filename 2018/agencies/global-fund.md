The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund) is now in the good category. 

It publishes to the IATI Registry on a monthly basis. 

The Global Fund publishes most indicators in the comparable IATI format, barring tenders and sub-national location. However, there are issues with the quality of the data as for six indicators the information did not meet the definition or was not up to date. 

Although the IATI publication is not always up to date, most of the information for the organisational and planning component is available on the organisation's website. Country strategies pose an exception as they are published inconsistently. The Global Fund does not receive any points for the two commitment indicators. No up-to-date data is provided on Global Fund’s project database and their freedom of information policy is over 10 years old. 

The Global Fund is among the top five performers for the finance and budgets component. All are published in an IATI format and scores highly for the majority of them. It is among the few organisations to score full points on disbursement and expenditures as well project budget documents. There is room for improvement with regards to disaggregated budgets and project budgets. 

The Global Fund scores full points on almost all project attributes indicators but faces some basic data quality issues with descriptions. Subnational locations can only be found sometimes on the organisation's website.

They perform well on all indicators within the joined-up development data component and is among the top five performers for this component. Although not available in an open and comparable format, tenders are published on the Global Fund’s website.

For the performance indicators, the Global Fund does well for objectives and results. However, in their IATI data no current documents for reviews and evaluations were provided and pre-project appraisal documents did not include the required information. Information on both these indicators is only sometimes provided in other formats.
