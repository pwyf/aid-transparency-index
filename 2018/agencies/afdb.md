The African Development Bank (AfDB) was established to promote regional cooperation and unity across the Africa region. It provides non-concessional and concessional loans, equity investments, loan guarantees, grants and technical assistance to lower and middle-income governments and the private sector. The AfDB became an IATI member in 2011 and started publishing IATI data in June 2013.

- Since the last Index, the bank improved its frequency of publication from quarterly to monthly
- The AfDB makes all of the information captured by the Index available in the IATI format - except for conditions data, which is not published
- The bank also launched a new project portal : http://projectsportal.afdb.org/dataportal/ 
- There is room for improvement in the publication of performance related information, specifically pre-project impact appraisals, reviews and evaluations and results.
- The Bankâ€™s lowest component ranking is for Joining up development data, with Project procurement contracts remaining the lowest scoring indicator.

The AfDB should make improvements on the publication of performance related information
The AfDB should harmonise its portals and the information made available on them so that its project portal and mapafrica can truly be accessible and reliable for interested data users.
As the portfolio of the Bank diversifies, the AfDB should also consider further extending its transparency efforts to private sector operations and share best practice with other banks and DFIs.
