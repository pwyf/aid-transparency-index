The African Development Bank (AfDB) was established to promote regional cooperation and unity across the Africa region. It provides non-concessional and concessional loans, equity investments, loan guarantees, grants and technical assistance to lower and middle-income governments and the private sector. The AfDB became an IATI member in 2011 and started publishing IATI data in June 2013.

- AfDB remains again in the very good category this year
- The Bank improved its frequency of publication from quarterly to monthly
- The AfDB makes all of the information captured by the Index available in the IATI format - except for conditions data which is not published
- The Bank also launched a new project portal : http://projectsportal.afdb.org/dataportal/ 
- There is room for improvement in the publication of performance related information, specifically pre-project impact appraisals, reviews and evaluations and results.
- While the Bank does comparatively well on Joining up development data, Project procurement contracts remains the lowest scoring indicator.
