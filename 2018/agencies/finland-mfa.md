The Department for Development Policy sits within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and is responsible for implementing Finland’s development cooperation. The four priority areas are the rights and status of women and girls; the growth of developing economies; deomcratic and better functioning societies; and food security, access to energy and sustainable use of natural resources. Finland has been an IATI member since 2008 and first published to IATI in November 2011.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland (Finland-MFA) has improved its transparency level, rising from the poor category in 2016 into the fair category.

Finland-MFA has improved the frequency of their publication from less than quarterly in 2016 to quarterly. 

Finland-MFA also improved on the publication of organisational planning indicators, providing all but country strategies in the IATI Standard. Yet these are consistently published in other formats.  

All indicators of the finance and budgets component are provided in the comparable IATI format but project budget documents, which are not published at all. Finland-MFA scores full points for total organisation budget but could improve their data for capital spend and project budgets.

Except for contact details, all indicators of the project attributes component are published in the comparable IATI format. Sub-national locations are provided to IATI but did not meet the definition and are inconsistently published in other formats. 

Within the joined-up development data component, conditions, tenders and contracts are not published to the IATI Registry. While tenders are always published in other formats, conditions and contracts are not published at all. 

Finland-MFA does not score on any of the performance indicators. While objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are published sometimes, results and pre-project impact appraisals are not being made available at all.
