The UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) is responsible for several streams of ODA and related funding, including spending allocations from some cross-government pooled funds, such as the Prosperity Fund and the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund. It also oversees bilateral development assistance programmes, diplomacy-related aid costs and some contributions to multilateral organisations. It is responsible for the British Council and the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. The UK FCO is not an IATI member but first published to IATI in July 2013.

The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is in the poor category. 

Publishes only less than quarterly. 

Only 53% of the indicators are published in the comparable IATI format and missing information tends not to be published in other formats either. 

With regards to organisational planning indicators, organisation strategy, annual reports and a procurement policy are made available in the FCO’s IATI organisation file but an allocation policy, a current audit and country strategies are missing. A current audit is made available on the website but information about allocation and country strategies are published inconsistently. 

The FCO provides information for all project attributes indicators in the IATI format except for sub-national location which is not published at all.

Four out of the seven indicators for joined-up development data are published in the IATI format, namely aid type, flow type, finance type and tied aid status. However, conditions, tenders and contracts are not published at all. 

The FCO does not provide any information for the performance indicators, neither via the IATI registry nor in other formats. 

Disbursements and expenditures as well as project budgets are published to IATI but data for any of the other finance and budget indicators is not published. Neither is a forward-looking total organisation budget nor are disaggregated budgets being made available.

UK-FCO should aim for quarterly, if not monthly publication.
