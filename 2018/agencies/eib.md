The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the European Union’s bank, owned by its member states. It works with other EU institutions to support EU policy and provides lending, blended finance and technical advice for investment both within and outside the EU. The EIB convenes a working group for DFIs to share best practice on publishing to IATI. They became an IATI member in 2013 and started publishing IATI data in September 2014.

- The European Investment Bank (EIB) remains in the fair category from 2016, retaining 24th position
- They continue to publish on at least a monthly basis
- Although EIB now publish annual project budgets to IATI, they perform relatively poorly on the finance and budgets component. Disbursement and expenditure data is very rarely reported, and project budget documents and disaggregated budgets are not available.
- While EIB do publish sectors to IATI, they don’t use DAC 5-digit sector codes
- Despite a low overall score on the performance component, EIB actually ranked relatively highly, by virtue of publishing objectives documents for all current activities
