The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the European Union’s bank, owned by its member states. It works with other EU institutions to support EU policy and provides lending, blended finance and technical advice for investment both within and outside the EU. The EIB convenes a working group for DFIs to share best practice on publishing to IATI. They became an IATI member in 2013 and started publishing IATI data in September 2014.

- EIB remain in the fair category from 2016, retaining 24th position
- They continue to publish on at least a monthly basis
- activity flow type is now published, and to IATI
- annual project budgets published to IATI
- While EIB do publish sectors to IATI, they still don’t use DAC 5-digit sector codes
- sampling, contracts (doesn't meet our definition)
- sampling, conditions data (not provided)
- sampling, annual report (linked report for 2016 only covers operations within the EU)
