The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the European Unionâ€™s bank, owned by its member states. It works with other EU institutions to support EU policy and provides lending, blended finance and technical advice for investment both within and outside the EU. The EIB convenes a working group for DFIs to share best practice on publishing to IATI. They became an IATI member in 2013 and started publishing IATI data in September 2014.
