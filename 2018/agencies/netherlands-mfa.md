The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands (Netherlands-MFA) remains in the good category. 
 
Netherlands-MFA publishes to the IATI Registry monthly.

Full points are achieved for all organisational planning documentation, with the exception of country strategies which is one of the lowest scoring indicators. 

Apart from capital spend, which is not published at all, all finance and budget indicators are provided in the IATI format. However, there is room for improvement for the disaggregated budgets indicator and project budget documents which is available in other formats.. 

All project attributes indicators are published to the IATI Registry. However, sub-national location is one of the lowest scoring indicators and both titles and descriptions contain many acronyms and are incomplete.  

The Netherlands-MFA does generally well on joined-up development data. Only information on procurement, namely tenders and contracts, is not made available in the IATI Standard. Tenders are always being made available in other formats. Contracts are not published. 

Within the performance component, the Netherlands-MFA only scores on objectives. Results are not being made available in other formats, neither are reviews and evaluations. Pre-project impact appraisals are sometimes provided.

Netherlands-MFA should ensure that basic information such as titles and descriptions are fully provided and are legible to non-exert data users.

It should improve its publication of sub-national locations to provide information on where its development work is being imlemented. 

It shold include tenders to its IATI publication and start publishing contracts.

It should prioritise timely, comprehenisve and consistent publication of performance-related indicators from pre-project impact apparaisals to eviews and evalations, and results. 

To demonstrate the impact of transparency on development work, Netherlands-MFA should take responsibility to promote the use of the data they publish, internally to promote coordination and effectiveness; and externally to explore online and in-person feedback loops, including at country level.
