The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (known as Minbuza) is the organisation responsible for Dutch bilateral development cooperation. The Netherlands was one of the founder members of IATI in 2008 and chaired the IATI Steering Committee between 2014 and 2016. It first published IATI data in September 2011. In April 2018, it became Chair of the IATI Governing Board and Member's Assembly.

The Netherlands-MFA remains in the good category 
It publishes to the IATI registry monthly.

The Netherlands do generally well on joined-up development data. Only information on procurement, namely tenders and contracts are not made available in the IATI Standard. Tenders are always being made available in other formats. Contracts are not published. 

Full points are achieved for all organisational planning documentation, with the exception of country strategies which score comparatively low. 

All project attributes indicators are published to IATI. However, sub-national location scores low. Both titles and descriptions contain many acronyms and are incomplete, resulting in lower scores for these two indicators.  

Apart from capital spend, which is not published at all, all finance and budget indicators are provided in the IATI format. However, disaggregated budgets score low and the project budget documents are not meeting the definition of the indicator. The latter are always being made available in other formats. 

Within the performance category, the Netherlands only score on objectives. While results are also published to IATI, they did not meet the definition. Results are not being made available in other formats, neither are reviews and evaluations. Pre-project impact appraisals are sometimes provided.
