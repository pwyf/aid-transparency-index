The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (known as Minbuza) is the organisation responsible for Dutch bilateral development cooperation. The Netherlands was one of the founder members of IATI in 2008 and chaired the IATI Steering Committee between 2014 and 2016. It first published IATI data in September 2011. In April 2018, it became Chair of the IATI Governing Board and Member's Assembly.

As in 2016, the Netherlands, MFA remain in the good category and publishes to the IATI registry monthly.

The Netherlands do well on joined-up development data, scoring high for aid type, conditions, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. The procurement indicators, tenders and contracts, are not published in a comparable format but tenders are always being made available in other formats. Contracts are not published. 

Full points are achieved for all organisational planning documentation, with the exception of individual country strategies which score comparatively low. 

All project attributes indicators are published in IATI. However, sub-national location scores low. Both titles and descriptions contain many acronyms and are incomplete, resulting in lower scores for these two indicators.  

Apart from capital spend, which is not published at all, all finance and budget indicators are provided in an IATI format. However, disaggregated budgets score low and the project budget documents are not meeting the definition of the indicator. The latter are always being made available in other formats. 

Within the performance category, the Netherlands only score on objectives. While results are also published in IATI, they are out of date or do not contain the required information. Results are not being made available in other formats, neither are reviews and evaluations. Pre-project impact appraisals are sometimes provided.
