Having changed its name in 2015, Global Affairs Canada is the largest grantor of Canadian ODA and leads Canada’s bilateral development assistance. Its priorities for 2017-18 include commitments to openness and transparency, in particular in evaluation and reporting. Canada will take Presidency of the G7 in 2018. It became a member of IATI in November 2011 and published its first quarterly data sets on October 31, 2012. Canada was Chair of the IATI Governing Board and Members Assembly until April 2018.

- Canada-Global Affairs remains in the good category
- It continues to publish on at least a monthly basis
- Canada-Global Affairs improved the comprehensiveness of its open and comparable publication. Contracts are now published to the IATI Registry, as well as annual report and allocation policy
- Since 2016, there has been a marked increase in the proportion of activities published to IATI for which results data is present
- While various documents are published to IATI as institutional strategies, we didn’t find a current overarching strategy document
- Canada-Global Affairs excelled on the Joining up development data component, ranking second overall.
- They could increase their score for the performance component by consistently publishing pre-project impact appraisals, and evaluation documents
- While Canada-Global Affairs don’t provide subnational location information in inline text, we note that they do use gazetteer references to locate activities by administrative regions.
