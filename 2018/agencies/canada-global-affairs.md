Its priorities for 2017-18 include commitments to openness and transparency, in particular in evaluation and reporting. Canada will take Presidency of the G7 in 2018. It became a member of IATI in November 2011 and published its first quarterly data sets on October 31, 2012. Canada was Chair of the IATI Governing Board and Members Assembly until April 2018.
