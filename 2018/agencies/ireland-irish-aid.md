Ireland-IrishAid is included in the fair category. 

The frequency of publication is still low as Ireland-IrishAid are publishing less than quarterly. 

It publishes 2/3 of the indicators in the IATI format. For the remaining third, apart for tenders which are available on the organisation's website, information is either not available at all or only sometimes.

Ireland-IrishAid scores full points for all organisational and planning indicators apart from country strategies, one of its lowest scoring indicators.

Within the finance and budget component, disaggregated budgets, disbursements and expenditures and total organisation budget are published in the comparable IATI format. Out of these, disaggregated budgets scores comparatively low and the total organisation budget is published for one year ahead only. The other finance and budget indicators, project budget, project budget documents, commitments and capital spend are not published at all. 

All project attributes indicators but sub-national location are published in a comparable format. Sub-national locations are only sometimes being made available in other formats. There is room for improvement when it comes to descriptions, planned dates and contact details. 

Ireland-IrishAid scores for five out of seven indicators of the joined-up development data component. Aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status are published to IATI and tenders are consistently made available in other formats. While contracts are sometimes provided on the organisation's website, no conditions are published. 

Ireland-IrishAid does not score on any of the performance indicators. The objectives provided to IATI did not meet the definition and are inconsistently published in other formats. Reviews and evaluations as well as results are sometimes published whereas pre-project impact appraisals are not being made available.

Ireland-IrishAid should aim for quarterly, if not monthly publication.
