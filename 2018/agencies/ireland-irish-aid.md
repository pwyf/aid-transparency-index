Ireland, IrishAid has made good progress by graduating from the poor to the fair category. 

Their data still lacks timeliness as they are publishing less than quarterly. 

IrishAid scores full points for all organisational and planning indicators apart from country strategies. These are also published in a comparable format but score low. 

Within the finance and budget component, only disaggregated budgets, disbursements and expenditures and total organisation budget are published in a comparable format. Out of these, disaggregated budgets scores very low and the total organisation budget is published for 1-year ahead only. The other finance and budget indicators, project budget, project budget documents, commitments and capital spend are not published at all. 

Ireland scores for five out of seven indicators of the joined-up development data component: aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status are published in IATI and tenders are consistently made available in other formats. While contracts are sometimes provided, no conditions are published. 

All project attributes indicators but sub-national location are published in an IATI format. Sub-national locations are only sometimes being made available in other formats. Ireland scores low for descriptions, planned dates and contact details. 

Ireland does not score on any of the performance indicators. The objectives provided in IATI do not meet the definition and are inconsistently published in other formats. Reviews and evaluations as well as results are sometimes published whereas pre-project impact appraisals are not being made available.
