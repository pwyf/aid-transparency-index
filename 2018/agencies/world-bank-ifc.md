The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is a member of the World Bank Group. It is the largest global development institution focused exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. It plays an important role in setting standards for the sector. The IFC became a member of IATI in 2017 and first published IATI data in that same year.

Following its first publication to the IATI Registry, the World Bank's International Finance Corporation (WB-IFC) progressed from the poor to the fair category. 

It now publishes on a monthly basis. 

WB-IFC publishes 59% of the indicators to IATI - from 0 in 2016. 

Within the fair category, WB-IFC is the organisation which scores highest on the organisational planning and commitments component. All organisational planning indicators are made available in the IATI format apart from allocation policy. But IFC’s allocation policy is published in other formats.

Performance for the joined-up development data component is mixed. While the IFC performs comparatively well on aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status, information about conditions, contracts and tenders is missing. These indicators are not published to IATI and although conditions information is sometimes available in other formats, contracts and tenders are not being made available at all. 

For the majority of project attributes indicators, the IFC performs well. However, they do not provide any information about planned end dates and are not using the standard code list for sectors. The IFC publishes sub-national location information to IATI but the information provided does not fulfil the requirements for this indicator. Sub-national locations for IFC projects can be found elsewhere but are not published consistently. 

The IFC does not score on any of the performance indicators but objectives. Results data in the IATI standard does not contain the required information and no results documents are provided. Results, pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are sometimes provided in other formats. 

The IFC’s score for the finance and budget component is below average. Only commitments are published in the IATI format. While project budgets are consistently published in a machine-readable format, no information at all is being made available for project budget documents, disbursement and expenditures and capital spend. The total organisation budget as well as disaggregated budgets are available for 1 year ahead only.
