The Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) is responsible for formulating European Commission (EC) humanitarian aid policy and delivering European Union relief assistance through its two main instruments: civil protection and humanitarian aid. The EC joined IATI in 2008 and DG ECHO began publishing to IATI in September 2013.

EC-ECHO remains in the good category. It has overtaken EC-NEAR and EC-DEVCO and is now leading among the three EC agencies. 

It publishes to the IATI registry on a monthly basis.

EC-ECHO is among the top 5 performers for the organisational planning and commitments as well as the project attributes component. 

For the organisational planning and commitments component, ECHO scores full points on all indicators but country strategies. ECHOâ€™s country strategies in IATI are not up to date. Current versions, however, can be found on its website. 

Information on project attributes indicators is generally made available although sub-national locations and implementers are the lowest scoring ones. 

EC-ECHO has started publishing capital spend to IATI and is one of the few organisations to score full points on disbursements and expenditures as well as project budgets. Disaggregated budget is the lowest scoring IATI indicator of the finance and budget component. Project budget documents are also provided in a comparable format but do not meet the definition of the indicator as they are not specific to individual activities. This information is not published elsewhere. 

EC-ECHO does well on basic joined-up development data indicators such as aid type, finance type, flow type or tied aid status. While made available in the IATI format, tenders were outdated and could only be found sometimes elsewhere. Contracts are not being made available in the IATI standard but are made available in other formats. 

Within the performance component, only objectives and pre-project impact appraisals are published in a comparable format. The pre-project impact appraisal documents provided in the IATI format are out of date while current versions are available elsewhere.  
Results are not published at all and reviews and evaluations are provided sometimes only.
