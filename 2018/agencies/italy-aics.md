In January 2016, Italy set up the Agency for Cooperation and Development (AICS). It is responsible for implementing Italy's development work across 20 key countries. AICS is in charge of Italy's IATI publication. It became an IATI member and first published IATI data in June 2017.

As they have started publishing to the IATI registry, publishing their data on a quarterly basis, Italy-AICS has made significant progress by moving up from the very poor to the fair category. 

Italy-AICS is now publishing data for 53% of the indicators in the comparable IATI format which is however still below the overall average.  

Italy-AICS is doing well on publishing basic project attributes. However, the sub-national location indicator in AICS’s IATI data does not contain sub-national location information and the information is not consistently provided in other formats. Actual dates are not made available.

None of the organisational and planning indicators score for IATI publication. A current annual report as well as an audit and a procurement policy can be found on the organisation’s website. Country strategies are published inconsistently and no organisation strategy nor an allocation policy are available. 

Italy-AICS scores for three out of the seven indicators of the finance and budgets component. They perform well on the commitments indicator and are the only organisation in the fair category to score on project budget documents. But other important financial information is missing. The project budget information published to the IATI registry is out of date and current information cannot be found elsewhere. No information is available for capital spend and disaggregated budgets.

All indicators of the joined-up development component are published to IATI. However, the contracts and tenders provided do not meet the definition. While tenders are consistently published in other formats, contracts are not being made available. 

Italy-AICS does not score on the majority of performance indicators. Objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are published in the IATI format but the latter do not contain the required information. They are not published in other formats. While results are sometimes published in other formats, pre-project impact appraisals are not provided.
