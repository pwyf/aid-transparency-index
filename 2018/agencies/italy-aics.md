In January 2016, Italy set up the Agency for Cooperation and Development (AICS). It is responsible for implementing Italy's development work across 20 key countries. AICS is in charge of Italy's IATI publication. It became an IATI member and first published IATI data in June 2017.

As they have started publishing to IATI, updating their data on a quarterly basis, Italy, AICS have made significant progress by moving up from the very poor to the fair category. 

Italy, AICS is publishing data for 53% of the indicators in the comparable IATI format which is below the overall average.  

Italy, AICS is doing well on publishing basic project attributes. However, the sub-national location indicator in AICS’s IATI data does not contain sub-national location information and the information is not consistently provided in other formats. Actual dates are not being made available.

Out of the six organisational and planning indicators, only the annual report is published in IATI. However, the data provided does not meet the definition of the indicator. A current annual report as well as an audit and a procurement policy can be found on the organisation’s website. Country strategies are published inconsistently and no organisation strategy nor an allocation policy are being made available. 

Italy, AICS scores for 3 out of the 7 indicators of the finance and budgets component. They perform well on the commitments indicator and are the only organisation in the fair category to score on project budget documents. But other important financial information is missing. The project budget information published to IATI is out of date and current information cannot be found elsewhere. No information is available for capital spend and disaggregated budgets. The total organisation budget is provided for 1-year ahead only.

All indicators of the joined-up development component are published in IATI and Italy, AICS scores moderately for aid type, finance type, flow type, tied aid status and conditions. However, the contracts and tenders provided do not meet the definition. While tenders are consistently published in other formats, contracts are not being made available. 

Italy, AICS does not score on the majority of performance indicators. Objectives as well as reviews and evaluations are published in an IATI format but the latter do not contain the required information. They are not published in other formats.  While results are sometimes published in other formats, pre-project project appraisals are not provided.
