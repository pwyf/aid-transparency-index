Established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) is responsible for the effective implementation of Korea's grant aid and technical assistance programmes. The Republic of Korea became an IATI member in January 2016 and first published IATI data in August of the same year.

Despite having started publishing to IATI, Korea-KOICA remains in the poor category.

Out of 36 indicators, only 10 are available in the comparable IATI format. Additionally, the data lacks timeliness as it is published less than quarterly. 

KOICA provides all organisational planning indicators, namely organisation strategy, annual reports, procurement policy, allocation policy, audits and country strategies on their website but does not publish them in a comparable format. 

Korea has updated its freedom of information policy and now scores full points for the quality of FOAI indicator. 

KOICA publishes all project attributes indicators apart from contact details and implementer in IATI. However, the data for both descriptions and sub-national location do not meet the definition of the given indicators. Information about the sub-national location of projects and contact details are consistently published in other formats whereas information about the implementer is only provided for some projects. 

Three out of seven indicators of the joined-up development data, namely flow data, aid type and finance type data, are made available in a comparable format. While not published in IATI, both contracts and tenders are always published in other formats. Conditions are published sometimes but no information is to be found about tied aid status. 

None of the performance indicators is published to IATI. While objectives are always published in other formats, other performance indicators, namely reviews and evaluations, results and pre-project impact appraisals are provided for some but not for all projects. 

KOICA does not publish any of the finance and budget indicators to IATI but consistently publishes commitments, capital spend and project budget documents on their website. Data on disbursements and expenditures as well as project budgets are not being made available.

Korea-KOICA should aim for quarterly, if not monthly publication.
