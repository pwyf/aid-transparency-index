Based in Geneva, GAVI is the Vaccine Alliance, an international organisation that was created in 2000 to improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in poor countries. It brings together public and private sectors with the shared goal of creating equal access to both new and existing vaccines for children. GAVI was a founding signatory to IATI in 2008 and first published IATI data in March 2012.

- GAVI remain in the good category from 2016, retaining 11th position
- They have increased their frequency of publication, now publishing on at least a monthly basis (previously less than quarterly)
- The lack of country strategy documents meant GAVI underperformed on the organisational planning component
- Since 2016, GAVI have begun publishing project budgets to IATI. They rank 4th overall on the finance and budgets component
- GAVI also rank 4th on the project attributes component, though their titles and descriptions both failed sampling
- contracts and tenders are no longer made available, and GAVI underperform on the joining up development data component
- GAVI also performed poorly on the performance component, with good results data, but few results documents. Objectives documents and evaluations documents were present on IATI, but both failed sampling.
