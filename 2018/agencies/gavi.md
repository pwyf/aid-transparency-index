Based in Geneva, GAVI is the Vaccine Alliance, an international organisation that was created in 2000 to improve access to new and underused vaccines for children living in poor countries. It brings together public and private sectors with the shared goal of creating equal access to both new and existing vaccines for children. GAVI was a founding signatory to IATI in 2008 and first published IATI data in March 2012.

- GAVI remain in the good category from 2016, retaining 11th position
- They have increased their frequency of publication, now publishing on at least a monthly basis (previously less than quarterly)
- Now publish project evaluations and project budgets to IATI
- However, contracts and tenders are no longer made available
- Several indicators failed sampling, due to data being insufficiently granular. These were objectives, reviews and evaluations, titles and descriptions.
- Country strategies/MoUs were also sampled and found to be out of date.
