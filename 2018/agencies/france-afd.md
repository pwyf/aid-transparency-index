AFD first published IATI data in April 2015 and became an IATI member in 2016.

After the past few years of progress, AFD seems to have stalled, and remains in the fair category, as in 2016. 

They have improved the timeliness of their data, now publishing quarterly. 

France, AFD performs well on the majority of the project attributes indicators but fails to publish actual dates and contact details in IATI. While contact details are sometimes made available, actual dates are not published at all. France, AFD is one of three organisation within the fair category to score on sub-national locations. 

Only one organisational and planning indicator, procurement policy, is available in a comparable format. Organisation strategy and audit are published in IATI but the documents do not contain the required information and are not provided elsewhere. While an annual report document is published on AFD’s website, no allocation policy is being made available. 

France, AFD scores high for basic joined-up development data, namely aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. While tenders are sometimes published in other formats, contracts and conditions are not published at all. 

Within the finance and budget component, France, AFD scores only for disbursement and expenditures as well as commitments. Project budgets are sometimes published but no project budget documents or capital spend information is being made available. Neither a forward-looking total organisation budget nor disaggregated budgets are provided.

For the performance component, AFD publishes only objectives in IATI. While scoring high on this indicator, the do not receive points for any of the other indicators. Pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are sometimes published whereas results are not being made available at all.
