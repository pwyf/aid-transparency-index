The French Development Agency (AFD) is a public agency central to French development cooperation. It works to combat poverty and foster development in the global South. AFD is responsible for funding projects, programmes and research and building capacity in developing countries. It is supervised by the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MEAE). AFD first published IATI data in April 2015 and became an IATI member in 2016.

The French Development Agency (France-AFD) remains in the fair category. 

It has improved the frequency of their publication, now publishing quarterly compared to less than quarterly in 2016. 

France-AFD also published a new transparency policy. 

Only two organisational and planning indicators, procurement policy and country strategies, are available in the comparable IATI format and includes the required information. However, country strategies is one of the lowest scoring indicators. Annual reports are always published in other formats and some information about the organisation strategy can also be found elsewhere.  Allocation policy and audit are not published. 

Within the finance and budget component, France-AFD scores only for disbursement and expenditures as well as commitments. Project budgets are sometimes published but no project budget documents or capital spend information is being made available. Neither a forward-looking total organisation budget nor disaggregated budgets are provided.

France-AFD performs well on the majority of the project attributes indicators and is one of three organisations within the fair category to score on sub-national locations. It fails however to publish actual dates and contact details to IATI. While contact details are sometimes made available, actual dates are not published at all. 

France-AFD does well on basic joined-up development data, namely aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. While tenders are sometimes published in other formats, contracts and conditions are not published at all. 

For the performance component, France-AFD publishes only objectives to the IATI Registry. They do not receive points for any of the other indicators. Pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are sometimes published whereas results are not being made available at all.
