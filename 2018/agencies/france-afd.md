France-AFD remains in the fair category. 

They have improved the frequncy of their publication, now publishing quarterly compared to less than quarterly in 2016. 

France-AFD also published a new transparency policy. 

France-AFD performs well on the majority of the project attributes indicators and is one of three organisations within the fair category to score on sub-national locations.  It fails however to publish actual dates and contact details to IATI. While contact details are sometimes made available, actual dates are not published at all. France-AFD is one of three organisations within the fair category to score on sub-national locations. 

Only one organisational and planning indicator, procurement policy, is available in a comparable format. 

France-AFD scores high for basic joined-up development data, namely aid type, finance type, flow type and tied aid status. While tenders are sometimes published in other formats, contracts and conditions are not published at all. 

Within the finance and budget component, France-AFD scores only for disbursement and expenditures as well as commitments. Project budgets are sometimes published but no project budget documents or capital spend information is being made available. Neither a forward-looking total organisation budget nor disaggregated budgets are provided.

For the performance component, AFD publishes only objectives to the IATI registry. They do not receive points for any of the other indicators. Pre-project impact appraisals as well as reviews and evaluations are sometimes published whereas results are not being made available at all.
