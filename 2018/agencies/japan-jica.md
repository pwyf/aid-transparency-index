The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan’s bilateral aid agency, delivers aid in the form of technical cooperation, ODA loans and grant aid in over 150 countries. It is also responsible for the provision of humanitarian aid under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. JICA is not an IATI member but first published IATI data in June 2014.

The Japan International Cooperation Agency (Japan-JICA) now is in the poor category.

Japan-JICA publishes on a less than quarterly basis to the IATI Registry. 

All organisational and planning indicators except country strategies are published to IATI. No current versions of the organisation strategy and allocation policy were provided in the comparable format but up to date documents can be found on the organisation’s website. Country strategies, however, are not published at all. 

Hardly any budgetary and financial information is being made available. Japan-JICA only publishes data on commitments as well as disbursements and expenditures in the IATI format. Information for capital spend, project budgets as well as project budget documents are not available at all. Neither are forward-looking total organisation budgets or disaggregated budgets being provided.

Despite doing well on the majority of the project attributes indicators, basic information such as titles and descriptions published to IATI did not meet the definitions. The sub-national locations provided in the IATI format did not contain the required information either. For some projects, they are provided in other formats. 

Japan-JICA scores on all indicators of the joined-up development data component. Contracts and tenders are not published in the comparable IATI format but the information is consistently made available elsewhere. 
 
Japan-JICA does not score for any of the performance indicators. Whereas objectives, pre-project impact appraisals and evaluations are sometimes being made available no results are being published.

Japan-JICA should aim for quarterly, if not monthly publication.
